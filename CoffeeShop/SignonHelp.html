<h1>Signon: Help</h1>
<p>This dialog provides the ability for a user to signon to
access extended features of the web site.  These features include:
  <ul>
    <li>Contribute to transcriptions of census, birth, marriage, and death
	databases.
    <li>Post blogs related to individual records in the family tree.
    <li>See private information on individual records in the family tree
	of which you have been granted shared ownership because you have
	demonstrated to an existing owner that you have a close
	relationship.
    <li>Update individual records in the family tree of which you have been
	granted ownership.  This includes adding new immediate relatives, such
	as spouses, parents, or children.
  </ul>
</p>
<p>You get to this dialog by clicking on the "Sign On" button in the
upper right-hand corner of any page in the genealogy section of the web-site.
Initially the dialog looks like:
</p>
<img SRC='Signon.png' alt='Sign on screenshot'>
<p>You sign on by entering your user identifier and password in the
indicated fields, and clicking on the
"Sign In" button at the bottom of the page body.
If there is a problem a message is displayed and you are given the opportunity
to sign on again.  Otherwise the 
<a href='genealogyHelpen.html'>top level genealogy web page</a> is displayed.
</p>
<p>If you wish to disable the extended features, for example to prevent
inadvertent alteration of the database, you can click on the
"Sign Off" button.
</p>
<p>If you do not have a user name for this site, you can create one by
clicking on the "Register" button.  This displays a dialog to
<a href='RegisterHelpen.html'>register a new user name</a>.
</p>
<p>Clicking on the "Close" button closes this dialog.
</p>
<p>For any other issue click on the "Contact Author" hyperlink in the
page footer.
