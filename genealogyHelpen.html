<h1>Genealogy: Help</h1>
<p>This website provides a broad range of genealogy related services,
generally focussing on, but not limited to, south-western Ontario.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <a href="/FamilyTree/nominalIndexHelpen.html">family tree</a> 
	of tens of thousands of individuals whose families have 
	passed through south-western Ontario, and in particular Middlesex
	County.  This is not a static family tree but rather a dynamic
	entity that can be contributed to by anyone interested in these
	families.  Since the facilities to update the tree are provided
	on the web, users can contribute to the tree from anywhere in the
	world, using any form of access.  There are two specific links
	in this section of the page:
	<ol>
	    <li>A link to the top level page which provides a
		<a href="/FamilyTree/ServicesHelpen.html">
			set of management tools</a>
		for all of the tables making up the
		family tree database.
	    <li>A link to the nominal index of the
		<a href="/FamilyTree/nominalIndexHelpen.html">
			Family Tree</a>.  This permits you to search
		for individuals by name and birth date.
	</ol>
    <li>Access to the contents of the database in machine readable form, 
	for use by applications
	running on this and other sites is provided by the pages
	<a href="/getRecordXmlHelpen.html">getRecordXml.php</a> and 
	<a href="/getRecordJsonHelpen.html">getRecordJson.php</a>.
    <li>Pointers to other sources of genealogical information broken down
	geographically.  This site focuses in particular on
	<a href="/Canada/genCanadaHelpen.html">Canada</a>, but there are also
	special sections on the
	<a href="/USA/genUSAHelpen.html">United States of America</a>, the
	<a href="/CCUK/genUKHelpen.html">United Kingdom</a>, and a collection of
	<a href="/genCommercialHelpen.html">sites that charge for information</a>.
    <li>A collection of user guides for particular issues in genealogy.  
    <li>Links to back issues of the monthly newsletter that is sent by
	e-mail to the registered contributors.
    <li>Links to back issues of the Monthly Technical Status Reports, which
	describe the changes made to the functionality of the web-site 
	each month, as well as a list of bugs that have been corrected.
</ul>
<p>All pages in this web site include a header and trailer section.
These sections display the hierarchy of web pages leading to the current
page, so you can quickly move back up the tree toward the top.  In addition
the trailer section contains a link to send a message to the site administrator
regarding the page. 
<p>The most important element of the header is the button
displayed in the upper right corner of the page.  This button tracks your
status as a user of the web site.  When a user first enters the web site this
button displays the text <span class="button">Contribute</span>. 
Clicking on the button displays a
<a href="/SignonHelpen.html">user signon/registration dialog</a>.  
Identifying yourself to the web-site
makes many additional features and services available.
Once you have signed on this button changes to display your user name.  If you
click on the button now it takes you to an 
<a href="/AccountHelpen.html">account management dialog</a>.
