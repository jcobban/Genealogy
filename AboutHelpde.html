      <h1>Über die Seite: Hilfe</h1>
      <p>Diese Website bietet eine breite Palette von Dienstleistungen rund
        um die Genealogie,
        im Allgemeinen mit Fokus auf den Südwesten Ontarios.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <a href="/FamilyTree/nominalIndexHelpen.html">family tree</a> 
        	of tens of thousands of individuals whose families have 
        	passed through south-western Ontario, and in particular Middlesex
        	County.  This is not a static family tree but rather a dynamic
        	entity that can be contributed to by anyone interested in these
        	families.  Since the facilities to update the tree are provided
        	on the web, users can contribute to the tree from anywhere in the
        	world, using any form of access.
        <li>Access to the contents of the database in machine readable form, 
        	for use by applications
        	running on this and other sites is provided by the pages
      	    <a href="/getRecordXmlHelpen.html">getRecordXml.php</a> and 
      	    <a href="/getRecordJsonHelpen.html">getRecordJSON.php</a>.
        <li>A wide range of transcriptions of original source documents.
            All genealogy sites support links from information in the
            Family Tree to original documents. These are called citations.
            A unique feature of this site is each item of transcribed
            information from original source documents is also linked to
            the individual in the family tree that it documents.  This
            permits quick identification of which original documents have
            not yet been analysed for incorporation into the family
            tree, and therefore where there is work remaining to do.
      </ul>
      <p>All pages in this web site include a header and trailer section.
        These sections display information about the page and services
        that you can access.
      <p>The most important element of the page header is the menu button
        displayed in the upper left corner of the page. This appears as three
        thick horizontal lines and is sometimes referred to as the 
        "hamburger patty" icon.  Clicking on this button displays a menu of
        services including:
      <ol>
        <li>The hierarchy of pages from the top of the site down to the
              immediate parent of the current page.
        <li>An item which tracks your current status
            as a user of the web site.  When a user first enters the web site
            item displays the text "Sign On". 
            Clicking on the item in this mode displays a
            <a href="/SignonHelpen.html">user signon/registration dialog</a>.  
            Identifying yourself to the web-site
            makes many additional features and services available.
            Once you have registered and signed on this item changes to
            display your user name.  If you
            click on the item now it takes you to an 
            <a href="/AccountHelpen.html">account management dialog</a>.
        <li>A list of items identifying each of the alternate languages
            for which the current page has been translated.  For example if
            there is an item Français then you can choose to communicate
            with the site in French.
        <li>A link to general help about the current page as a whole. This is
            as opposed to the item specific popup help that is displayed
            when you hold the mouse over an item.
        <li>A link to general information about the site as a whole.
      </ol>
      <p>The trailer section contains a link to send a message
        to the site administrator(s) and any other users associated with
        the information on the page in a secure manner.
