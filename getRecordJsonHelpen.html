  <h1>Get Database Record in JSON: Help
  </h1>
  <p>This page describes the use of the script getRecordJSON.php
which is used to extract the content of database records in
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), to support external access to the
internal content of the database.
  </p>
  <p>The user must be signed in as a user to use this feature.
The contents of the response to a request depends upon the level of
authorization of the requesting user.  In particular a requesting user
can only see information that the user is authorized to see.  For example
private information about an individual in the family tree is only visible
to members of that individual's family.
  </p>
  <p>The record or records to be returned is specified by parameter passed
by method "Get", that is by parameters passed as part of the 
Uniform Record Location (URL).  The parameter names are case insensitive.
For example you can specify "...?table=Picture" or "...?Table=Picture", "...&amp;id=756" or "...&amp;ID=756".
  <p>If you add the parameter "&amp;debug=Y" to the query then the generated
document will include a trace of how the response was generated.
This trace is in HTML and may include characters that cause it to not be
valid JSON.
  </p>
  <p>The table to be examined is identified by the parameter "table", which
can have one of the following case-sensitive values:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="label">Addresses</th>
