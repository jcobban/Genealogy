    -->
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpRegDomain'>
      The registration domain, for example province or state, to be searched.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpRegYear'>
      The year the marriage was registered.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpRegNum'>
      The registration number within the year.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpCount'>
      The number of entries per page to return.  The default is 20.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpRegCounty'>
      Limit the response to marriages registered in the specified county.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpRegTownship'>
      Limit the response to marriages registered in the specified municipality within
      a county.  A municipality may be a city, town, or township.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpGivenNames'>
      <p>Limit the response to individuals whose given names match the
      pattern in this field.  This search is done as a 
      case-insensitive pattern match, not a simple comparison. 
      </p>
      <p>Specifying simple text, comprising letters and spaces, matches against
      any names containing that text.  "John" or "john" or "JOHN" will match
      "Johnathan" and "William John" as well as the simple "John".
      </p>
      <p>The text may be a 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
          	regular expression</a>.
      There are too many options to enumerate here, but a few examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want to match just the name "John", excluding names
            that include "John" as part of them, enter "^John$".
        </li>
        <li>Enumerators often use unusual spellings of names.  For example
            if you to match names including both "Henry" and "Henery",
            enter "Hen.*ry".
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpSurname'>
      <p>This field is used to specify text to look for in the surname of 
      the person getting married.
      If the value contains only letters and spaces then only surnames that match
      exactly (except for case) are found.  Otherwise this
      uses 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
          	regular expression</a> pattern matching.
      For example to match surnames starting with "McL..." and ending with "...n",
      such as "McLean", "McLain", "McLennan", or "McLellan" you could specify 
    "^McL.*n$".
      </p>
    <p>The meaning of this field changes if the Soundex option is selected.
      </p>
      <p>The Soundex code has been used for decades to attempt to match names
      that sound similar.  For example it is used by police forces to perform
      a rough match for the names of drivers.  It is a problematic tool, as it
      is based upon the phonetics of British surnames.
      If you select Soundex then the search
      is made for surnames that "sound like" the given surname.  For example
      specifying Soundex together with "McLean" will match all of the surnames
      in the pattern match example under "Surname", but many other names
      as well, such "McCallum", "McAllan", "McClain", and "McWilliams". 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpSurnameSoundex'> 
      The Soundex code has been used for decades to attempt to match names that
      sound similar.  For example it is used by police forces to perform a rough
      match for the names of drivers.  It is a problematic tool, as it
      is based upon the phonetics of British surnames.
      If you select this option along with a
      complete surname, not a pattern match, in the Surname field, then
      the search
      is made for surnames that "sound like" the given surname.  For example
      specifying Soundex together with "McLean" will match all of the 
      surnames in
      the pattern match example under "Surname", but many other names as well, 
      such "McCallum", "McAllan", "McClain", and "McWilliams". 
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpOccupation'>
      This option is used to search for marriages based upon the
      occupation of the person getting married. 
      This field uses 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
          	regular expression</a> pattern matching.  
      For example searching for 
      "Labo[u]{0,1}rer" will match any occupation that contains either "Laborer"
      or "Labourer", including "Farm Labourer" and "R'y Laborer".
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpBYear'>
      The Birth Year and Range fields are used to search for
      individuals based upon their approximate birth year as calculated
      based upon the age at the time of marriage. 
      If Range is not specified then the Birth Year must match
      exactly, but you can use Range to perform an imprecise search.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpRange'>
      The Range field specifies a range of years on either side of the specified
      Birth Year.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpPlace'>
      This option is used to search for individuals based upon where they were
      married.  This is a pattern match.  For example searching for "Canada"
      will also match "Canada East", "Canada West", "Lower Canada",
      and "Upper Canada".
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpDate'>
      This field is used to specify text to look for in date of marriage.
      For example searching for "1910" will find people who were married in
      1910.
      Specifying "Jan" will find people who were married in January.
      Specifying "23" will find people who were married either on the 23rd of a
      month, or in 1823 or 1923.
      In more detail this field uses 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
          regular expression</a> pattern matching.  For example
          '[[:&lt;:]]23[[:&gt;:]]' matches dates containing '23' as a word, and
          so could be used to match individuals married on the 23rd of
          any month.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpInformant'>
      This field is used to search for marriage registrations based upon
      the name of the person who reported the marriage.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpInformantRel'>
      This field is used to search for marriage registrations based upon the
      relationship of the person reporting the marriage to the 
      person getting married.  For example
    "Father" or "Brother" or "Aunt".
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpInfOcc'>
      This field is used to search for marriage registrations based upon the
      occupation of the person reporting the marriage.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpInfRes'>
      This field is used to search for marriage registrations based upon the
      address of the informant.
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpReligion'>
      This option is used to search for individuals based upon their
      religious affiliation.  This is a pattern match. 
      For example searching for
      "Meth" will match any religion containing that string, including 
      "Wesleyan Methodist", "C. Meth.", "New Connexion Methodist", 
      and "Methodist Episcopal".
    </div>
    <div class='balloon' id='HelpFatherName'>
