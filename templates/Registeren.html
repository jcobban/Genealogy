		In this field enter the user name by which you wish to be known to the
		service.  You will use this name each time you sign on
		to contribute to or access private contents of the
		web site.  This should be something that is easy for you to remember,
		but that does not reveal private information about yourself such as
		your e-mail address.  Your user name must be at least 6 characters long.
		It may not contain  '&lt;', '&gt;', '@', or '&amp;'.
		It may contain any other characters including spaces.  Spaces
		entered at the beginning or end of the user name are ignored.
		For example "Αλεξανδρος Μεγαλος" is a valid user name
		as is "Ива́н Гро́зный"
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='balloon' id='Helppassword'>
    <p>
		Enter the password you wish to use to verify your identity when you
		sign on to contribute to the web site.  This should be something that it
		would be difficult for someone else to guess so it should not contain
		information that is publicly known about you.  Your browser will
		probably assist you to remember this value. 
		The password must be at least 6 characters
		long and may be up to 64 characters long and can contain
		any characters including spaces that you can enter.
		As you enter the password a running score will be displayed of the
		strength of the password.  
		It is up to you to protect your privacy.
		The value of the password is not displayed.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='balloon' id='Helppassword2'>
    <p>
		You must enter the password for the user name
		twice to avoid possible typing errors which would make the user name
		inaccessable.
		The value of the new password is not displayed.

 <div class="balloon" id="HelpgeneratePassword">

		Click on this button to generate a random password constructed from the

		If this is checked then messages will be sent to the associated e-mail
		address regarding changes in the web-site such as new features and
		capabilities.
		Generally this will be no more frequently than once a month.
		These notices will also be posted to the web-site so if you do not wish
		to receive e-mail notices,
		you will still have access to the information.
		If you clear this checkbox then the only e-mail you will receive
		will be the
		one used to verify the existence of your e-mail address.

  <div class='balloon' id='Helpnohelp'>
