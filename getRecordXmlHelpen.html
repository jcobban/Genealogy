  <h1>Get Database Record in XML: Help
  </h1>
  <p>This page describes the use of the script getRecordXml.php
which is used to extract the content of database records in
eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
  </p>
  <p>The user must be signed in as a user to use this feature.
The contents of the response to a request depends upon the level of
authorization of the requesting user.  In particular a requesting user
can only see information that the user is authorized to see.  For example
private information about an individual in the family tree is only visible
to members of that individual's family.
  </p>
  <p>The record or records to be returned is specified by parameters passed
by method "Get", that is by parameters passed as part of the 
Uniform Record Location (URL).  The parameter names are case insensitive.
For example you can specify "...?table=Picture" or "...?Table=Picture",
"...&amp;id=756" or "...&amp;ID=756".
  </p>
  <p>The table to be examined is identified by the parameter "table", which
can have one of the following case-sensitive values:
  </p>
