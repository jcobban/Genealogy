        <h1>Issue SQL Command Help</h1>
      <p>This is an administrator tool to permit correcting problems in the
      contents of the database that cannot be corrected through any of the normal
      tools.  It permits issuing a wide range of SQL data manipulation commands
      to apply changes directly to the database.
      <p>The tool provides two key functions that are not available through
      the standard MySql client command line tool:
      <ol>
        <li>Before an update command is performed the user is warned of how many
    	lines will be affected by the command.  This permits catching
    	situations where the WHERE clause of an UPDATE or DELETE is too
    	vague and therefore matches too many lines of the database.
        <li>Each update command issued through this tool is logged along with
    	updates performed by the standard user tools, so that they are included
    	if the log is used to restore the database after a disk failure.
      </ol>
