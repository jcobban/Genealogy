        <h1>Census Response to Search Help</h1>
    <p>The response to a search of any census database consists of a tabular
    display of key fields in each of the matching records, along with the option
    to examine any particular record in more detail.
    <p>If the query request was for all rows of a specific page of the census then
    there are some additional options presented at the top of the page:
    <ul>
        <li>A link to a <a href="/database/CensusUpdateStatusHelpen.html">
    	district by district summary</a> of the status of the
    	transcription for this census.
        <li>A link to a <a href="/database/CensusUpdateStatusDistHelpen.html">
    	division by division summary</a> of the status of the
    	transcription of the current district.
        <li>A link to the <a href="/database/CensusUpdateStatusDetailsHelpen.html">
    	page by page status</a> of the division to which the
    	current page belongs.
        <li>A <span class="button">See All Fields</span>
    	button to display the complete transcription of the selected page.
        <li>A <span class="button">Display Image</span>
    	button to see the image of the original census page.
    </ul>
    <p>Above the returned results there is a navigation and summary line.  
    This has three parts:
    <ul>
        <li>An arrow
    	(<span style="color: blue;text-decoration:underline;">&lt;---</span>)
    	pointing left as a link.  Clicking on this takes
    	you to the previous page of results if there are multiple pages.
    	If the request was for a specific family in the database, then this
    	takes you to the previous family.  If the request was for a specific
    	page of the transcription, this takes you to the previous page in
    	the division.
        <li>A summary indicating how many, and which, rows of the response are
    	displayed, and how many rows there are in the complete result.
    	For example: <b>returned rows 1 to 20 of 53</b>.
    	If the request was for a complete family this line identifies the
    	family.  For example:
    	<b>dist 97 Middlesex West, subdist 9 Delaware, family 57</b>.
    	If the request was for a complete page this line identifies the
    	page.  For example:
    	<b>dist 97 Middlesex West, subdist 9 Delaware, page 5</b>.
        <li>An arrow
    	(<span style="color: blue;text-decoration:underline;">---&gt;</span>)
    	pointing right as a link.  Clicking on this
    	takes you to the next page of results if there are multiple pages.
    	If the request was for a specific family in the database, then this
    	takes you to the next family.  If the request was for a specific
    	page of the transcription, this takes you to the next page in
    	the division.
    </ul>
    <p>The bulk of the page is taken up with the identifying fields from the
    result of the search, displayed as a table.  The columns of the table 
    consist of:
    <ul>
        <li>A <span class="button">Details</span> button. 
    	Clicking on this takes you to a
    	<a href="/database/CensusDetailsHelpen.html">
    	page listing the value of every field</a> in the specific record.
        <li>If the request is for all of the members of a family or all the
    	lines on a page, then the page number and line number are displayed.
        <li>If the request was for a search of all censuses, not just for a
    	single enumeration, the census identifier and province identifier
    	are displayed.
        <li>The name of the matching individual, surname first followed by
    	the given names.  This is color coded based upon the sex of the 
    	individual.  If the line has been linked to the family tree then
    	this underlined to show that it is a hyperlink to the associated
    	individual page in the family tree.
        <li>The (calculated) birth year of the individual.
        <li>The birth place of the individual.
        <li>The occupation of the individual.
        <li>The enumeration sub-district (usually town, township, or city ward)
    	in which the record was found.
    </ul>
    <p>Below the returned results there is a navigation line.  
    This has two parts:
    <ul>
        <li>An arrow
    	(<span style="color: blue;text-decoration:underline;">&lt;---</span>)
    	pointing left as a link.  Clicking on this takes
    	you to the previous page of results if there are multiple pages.
    	If the request was for a specific family in the database, then this
    	takes you to the previous family.  If the request was for a specific
    	page of the transcription, this takes you to the previous page in
    	the division.
        <li>An arrow
    	(<span style="color: blue;text-decoration:underline;">---&gt;</span>)
    	pointing right as a link.  Clicking on this
    	takes you to the next page of results if there are multiple pages.
    	If the request was for a specific family in the database, then this
    	takes you to the next family.  If the request was for a specific
    	page of the transcription, this takes you to the next page in
    	the division.
