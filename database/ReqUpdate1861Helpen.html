    <h1>1861 Census of Canada: Update: Help</h1>
<p>This form is used to identify a specific page of the 1861 census of
Canada to be transcribed, or to update the transcription.
<p>In 1861 the Imperial census of British North America covered 3 colonies:
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Canada.  The Colony of Canada was divided
administratively into Canada East, formerly known as Lower Canada and entirely
contained within the modern province of Quebec, and Canada West, formerly known
as Upper Canada and entirely contained within the modern province of Ontario.
<p>The census is divided into enumeration districts.
Each district corresponds to a county.
Each district was uniquely numbered in alphabetical order within province 
by the later Dominion Bureau of Statistics
when the census was microfilmed in the 1950s and the original paper
documents discarded.
<p>Each enumeration district was subdivided into sub-districts, generally
corresponding to municipalities (townships, towns, villages, 
wards within cities).  Each sub-district was assigned a sequential
number within the province, note <b>not</b> within the district, when
the census was microfilmed in the 1950s.
<p>If the population of a sub-district was too large to be handled by a single
enumerator, the sub-district was divided into enumeration divisions,
usually identified numerically, although in some cases identified by ward
names even in rural townships which were not administratively divided into
wards.
<p>Within the enumeration division pages are identified numerically.
This is messy because although most enumerators numbered the pages within 
their divisions, some did not.  Furthermore since each census entry spanned
4 pages some enumerators incremented their page numbers every page, some every
other page, and most only at the beginning of a set of new entries.
When the census was microfilmed in the 1950s
the pages were sequentially numbered within each sub-district, not division, 
using a rubber stamp.  Again the structure of the entries caused complications.
Most of the time the number increments only at the beginning of a set of new
entries, but sometime it increments every time the page was turned, that is the
page number increments by 2 for each set of new entries.
<p>The application requires that you:
<ol>
    <li>Optionally identify the province to restrict the displayed list
	of districts (presented alphabetically by district name).
    <li>Identify the district by selecting from the displayed list.
    <li>Select the sub-district from the list displayed once you have
	selected a district.
    <li>If the sub-district is divided into multiple divisions, a selection
	list is presented from which you must select a division.
    <li>Select the page from the selection list of page numbers that is
	presented once you have selected the enumeration division.  For
	consistency the numbering scheme from the microfilming stage, from
	the rubber-stamped numbers, is used.
</ol>
<p>Once you have selected the page, click on the 
<span class="button">Request Form</span> button.
The application displays a 
<a href="CensusForm1861Helpen.html">data entry form</a>
that can be updated like a spreadsheet.
This form matches the layout of the
original census image.  If the page has already been transcribed this form
contains the current contents of the transcription.
<p>Immediately following the <span class="button">Request Form</span>
button there is a 
<span class="button">Progress Display</span> button.
Click on this to display an
<a href="CensusUpdateStatusHelpen.html">overview of the transcription status
</a> of the 1861 census.  This shows the district by district progress of
the transcription effort.  It also provides an alternate method to identify
a page to view, transcribe, or update within divisions for which the
transcription has already begun.
