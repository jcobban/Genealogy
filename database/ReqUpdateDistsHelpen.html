        <h1>Census District Table Help</h1>
    <p>Each census of Canada is divided into enumeration districts.
    Prior to confederation each district corresponded to a county or
    city.  In the post-confederation censuses each district generally
    corresponds to a federal electoral district (called a riding in Canada);
    <p>All of the information that the application requires to know about a
    district is collected in the District Table.
    This includes:
      <ul>
        <li>The 6 character identifier of the census.  Normally this consists of the
    	2 character country code, 'CA' for Canada, 
    	and the 4 digit enumeration year.  However for the
    	pre-confederation censuses, which were administered separately in
    	each of the colonies, the country code is replaced by a
    	two character abbreviation for the colony, for example 'CW' for
    	Canada West (previously called Upper Canada, and subsequently Ontario).
        <li>The numeric identifier of the district.  This is almost always
    	a sequential integer, however in a couple of cases the district
    	number includes a fractional component (.5).
        <li>The English name of the sub-district.
        <li>The French name of the sub-district.
        <li>The two character abbreviation for the province.
      </ul
    </p>
    <p>The application requires that you uniquely
    identify the census year, and optionally (except for pre-confederation
    censuses) the province.
    Once you have made that selection the
    application displays the portion of the District table including 
    all of the districts in the selected census region.
    <p>Once you have selected the district, click on the "Request Form" button.
    The application displays the information on all of the districts
    in the requested census and province in a 
    <a href="DistFormHelpen.html">tabular form</a>
    that can be updated like a spreadsheet.
