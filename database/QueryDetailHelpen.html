        <h1>Census Query Response Help</h1>
    <p>This page presents an abbreviated summary of the records that match
    the query that you requested.
    </p>
    <p>If the census query was a request to return all of the lines in a page 
    there is a <span class="button">See All Fields</span> 
    button at the top of the page.  
    Clicking on this button with the mouse changes the display 
    to a form that contains all of the fields in the transcription.  If you are
    authorized this form permits you to modify the transcription.
    </p>
    <p>Above the table there is a row that contains:
    <ul>
      <li>A left pointing arrow that is a hyperlink to the data set immediately
    	preceding the displayed set of rows.  The meaning of this depends upon
    	the context.  If the request returned more records than can be
    	displayed at one time according to the specified value of "Count" in
    	the request, then this arrow points to the previous block of records if
    	you have paged forward through the set.  On the first block of 
    	responses this has no meaning.  However if your request was for all of
    	the members of a specific family, then clicking on this arrow displays
    	the preceding family in the division.  On the other hand if your request
    	was for a complete page from the division, then clicking on this
    	arrow displays the preceding page from the division.
      <li>Text which describes where you are within the returned data set.
    	For example "returned rows 1 to 20 of 44" indicates that the first
    	20 records from the data set are currently displayed, and there are
    	a total of 44 matching records.
      <li>A right pointing arrow that is a hyperlink to the data set immediately
    	following the displayed set of rows.  The meaning of this depends upon
    	the context.  If the request returned more records than can be
    	displayed at one time according to the specified value of "Count" in
    	the request, then this arrow points to the next block of "Count" 
    	records.  On the last block of 
    	responses this has no meaning.  However if your request was for all of
    	the members of a specific family, then clicking on this arrow displays
    	the following family in the division.  On the other hand if your request
    	was for a complete page from the division, then clicking on this
    	arrow displays the following page from the division.
