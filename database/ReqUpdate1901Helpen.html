    <h1>1901 Census of Canada: Update: Help</h1>
<p>This form is used to identify a specific page of the 1901 census of
Canada to be transcribed, or to update the transcription.
<p>In 1901 the Dominion of Canada comprised 7 provinces: Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and
British Columbia, plus the North-West Territories (including the Yukon
Territory). 
<p>The census is divided into enumeration districts.
Each district generally
corresponds to a federal electoral district (called a riding in Canada),
which were very roughly similar in population based upon the preceding
census.  Each district was uniquely numbered.  For this census the district
numbers were assigned alphabetically within each province.
<p>Each enumeration district was subdivided into sub-districts, generally
corresponding to municipalities (townships, towns, villages, 
wards within cities).  Each sub-district was assigned an alphabetic code.
If there were more than 26 sub-districts, the sequence continued with A'
through Z', followed by A" through Z".
<p>If the population of a sub-district was too large to be handled by a single
enumerator, the sub-district was divided into enumeration divisions,
identified numerically.
<p>Within the enumeration division pages are identified numerically.
<p>The application requires that you:
<ol>
    <li>Optionally identify the province to restrict the displayed list
	of districts (presented alphabetically by district name).
    <li>Identify the district by selecting from the displayed list.
    <li>Select the sub-district from the list displayed once you have
	selected a district.
    <li>If the sub-district is divided into multiple divisions, a selection
	list is presented from which you must select a division.
    <li>Select the page from the selection list of page numbers that is
	presented once you have selected the enumeration division.
</ol>
<p>Once you have selected the page, click on the "Request Form" button.
The application displays a 
<a href="CensusForm1901Helpen.html">data entry form</a>
that can be updated like a spreadsheet.
This form matches the layout of the
original census image.  If the page has already been transcribed this form
contains the current contents of the transcription.
<p>Immediately following the "Request Form" button there is a 
"Progress Display" button.  Click on this to display an
<a href="CensusUpdateStatusHelpen.html">overview of the transcription status
</a> of the 1901 census.  This shows the district by district progress of
the transcription effort.  It also provides an alternate method to identify
a page to view, transcribe, or update.
