      <h1>District Level Census Transcription Status: Help</h1>
      <p>This page displays a summary of progress on the
    transcription of a particular district of a census of Canada.  
    It displays one row for each
    census division in the district whether or not any transcription work
    has been performed.  This page therefore provides a convenient way to
    identify all work to be done in the district.
      <p>For each division it displays:
      <ol>
        <li>The sub-district identifier.  For the 1871 through 1901 censuses this
    	is generally a letter of the alphabet.  For other censuses it is a
    	sequential number, either within the province for pre-confederation
    	censuses, or within the district.
        <li>The division number, if any.
    	Note that although divisions were not officially used for post-1901 
    	censuses there are sub-districts which comprise several separate
    	enumerations, each with their unique sequence of page numbers and
    	family numbers.  These are treated by this application as
    	separate divisions.
        <li>The name of the sub-district.
        <li>The number of individuals transcribed so far within the division.
    	Note that individuals for whom the name has been transcribed but not 
    	the age at the time of the enumeration count for only 1/2.
        <li>The total number of individuals enumerated within the division.
        <li>The percentage completion of the transcription.  
    	This field is color-coded running from dark
    	red for no work done so far through to bright green for 100% completion.
        <li>The percentage of individuals in the division who have been linked
    	to the family tree.  This field is color-coded running from dark
    	red for no work done so far through to bright green for 100% completion.
        <li>A "button" to display 
    	<a href="/database/CensusUpdateStatusDetailsHelpen.html">the status of each
    	page within the division</a>.
      </ol>
      <p>At the bottom of the table the total number of individuals transcribed
    in this district is displayed, along with the total number of individuals
    enumerated within the district, 
    the color-coded percentage completion of the transcription for the district,
    and the color-coded percentage completion of linking to the family tree.
