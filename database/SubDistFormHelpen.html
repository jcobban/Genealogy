        <h1>Census Administration: Sub-Districts Table Help</h1>
      <p>Each district of a census of Canada is divided into sub-districts.
        Generally a sub-district corresponds to a township, town, large village,
        or a ward in a city.  The 6 character identifier of the census, and  
        the name and numeric identifier of the district containing the
        sub-districts are displayed at the bottom and top of the table.
      </p>
      <p>All of the information that the application requires to know about a
        sub-district (or enumeration division) is collected in the Sub-District
        Table.
      </p>
      <p>This form presents the information on all of the sub-districts and
        enumeration divisions in a requested district as a table that can be
        manipulated like a spreadsheet.  If authorized you can alter the value
        of any fields in the table, and can add and delete rows from the table.
        If you hold the cursor over any field in
        the form, or over one of the buttons, context specific help pops up.
      </p>
      <p>The column headers of the table respond to mouse clicks.  If you click
        on the left button of the mouse the column header and the contents of the
        column are hidden from view, permitting you to shrink the horizontal
        space required to display the contents of the table.  If you then click
        the left button of the mouse while holding it over the narrow space where
        the column header was previously, the header and contents of the column
        are displayed.
      </p>
      <p>If you click the right button of the mouse while holding it over a
        column header, then the space used to display the contents of that column
        is increased by 50%.  This is useful when the description of the
        subdistrict is unusually long, for example in the Prairie Provinces.
      </p>
      <p>The body of the form functions like a spreadsheet, particularly with
        respect to special key strokes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The forward and backward tab keys, and the left and right arrow keys,
    	change the selected input field in the table
    	to the left or the right. Motion wraps around at the left and right
    	edges of the table.
        <li>The up and down arrows change the selected input field in the table 
    	up or down one row at a time.
    	Motion wraps around at the bottom and top of the table.
        <li>The "Home" key repositions the text cursor at the beginning of the
    	current input field.  The "End" key repositions the text cursor
    	after the last character in the current input field.
        <li>The "Ctl-Home" key combination selects the first input field in the row.
    	The "Ctl-End" key combination selects the last input field in the row.
        <li>The "Ctl-Z" key combination discards whatever you have typed in the
    	current input field, and restores the value to what it was when the
    	page was first displayed.
        <li>The "Enter" key changes the selected cell in the table down
    	one row at a time, rather than submitting the form as happens on
    	simpler forms.
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The columns of the table represent:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The identifier of the sub-district within the district.  For some
    	censuses (1851, 1861, 1906, 1911, 1921) this is a number.  For others it
    	is an alphabetic code, such as a letter, a combination of letters,
    	or a letter followed by a roman numeral exponent.
    	<p>This is part of the unique key of the sub-district.  Caution must 
    	be taken in changing it to ensure that the combination of
    	sub-district and division remains unique within the district.
    	</p>
          <li>The division number if the sub-district is divided into divisions.
    	There is a separate record in this table for each division.
    	<p>This is part of the unique key of the sub-district.  Caution must 
    	be taken in changing it to ensure that the combination of
    	sub-district and division remains unique within the district.
    	</p>
          <li>The name of the sub-district.
    	This does not have to be the same in
    	all divisions of the sub-district, although that is normally the case.
          <li>The number of pages in the population (enumeration of the living)
    	schedule.
    	This is a decimal number.
          <li>The first page number in the division.  In most cases this is 1.
    	However in the 1851 and 1861 censuses the pages were not 
    	consistently numbered by the enumerators, and the pages were 
    	subsequently numbered sequentially through the entire sub-district
    	when the original documents were microfilmed (and the originals
    	destroyed!).
          <li>The page increment within the division.  In a few cases when the
    	1851 and 1861 census pages were numbered, during the microfilming
    	process, the technician incremented the page number twice for
    	each leaf of the schedule of the living because information about
    	the individuals was recorded on both the <i>recto</i> and the 
    	</i>verso</i> of
    	each leaf.  In this case the application has to know that only the
    	odd page numbers are used to identify the page[s] containing
    	information on an individual.
          <li>The total number of individuals in the division. 
    	This is a decimal number.  This is used
    	by the web pages that track the progress of the transcription.
    	It is initialized to to assume that the last page of the division
    	is half-full.  In many censuses the actual number of individuals in
    	the division is written on the last page of the census.
          <li>Library &amp; Archives of Canada (LAC) microfilm reel identifier.
          <li>Church of Latter Day Saints (LDS) Family History Library (FHL) 
    	microfilm reel number.
          <li>The "Image Base", and "Relative Frame" fields identify the crucial
    	numeric values that are used to compute the Uniform Record Locator
    	(URL) of the image of the first page of the population schedule.
    	The exact meaning of these two fields depends upon the census.
    	These are decimal numbers.
          <li>The number of images for this division on the web site.
    	This is a decimal number.
          <li>A column of descriptive remarks.
          <li>A button to add a division after the current row.  
    	The new row is added with the same
    	sub-district identifier, name, LAC Reel identifier, and LDS Reel
    	identifier as the current row.  The division number is set to
    	one higher than the division number of the current row.
    	Note that the application does not ensure uniqueness of the
    	record key. 
          <li>A button to delete a sub-district or enumeration division 
    	from the table.
          <li>A link to the form for editting the Page table for the division.
          <li>For some censuses a button to display the first image in the 
    	division.
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Once you have made all of the changes to the data you apply the
        changes to the database by using the mouse to click on the 
        <span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate Database</span> button.
        Alternatively you can use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl-S or Alt-U.
        If you have accidentally created divisions with duplicate identification
        fields they are flagged and you must resolve the duplication before
        submitting the changes.
