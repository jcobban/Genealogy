    <h1>How to Update the Pages Table</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>Pages</b> table is intended to provide information on each page 
      of each division of the enumeration of living individuals of all of
      the censuses, starting with the 1851/2 and 1861 censuses of the 
      Colony of Canada, and including the 1871, 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911
      and 1921 censuses of the Dominion of Canada, and
      the 1906 and 1916 censuses of the prairie provinces.
      The table is not complete because there is no automated way to
      collect all of the necessary information.  The  
      <a href="ReqUpdatePagesHelpen.html" target="_blank">Edit Pages Table</a>
      page is used to manage the collection of this information.
    </p>
    <p>Further information on the use of each of the fields on this page
      is available by holding the mouse over any field or button on the page.
    </p>
    <p>This page prompts for the complete identification of an enumeration
      division.  When you first enter this page it appears like:
    </p>

    <p id="Census">
      The Census selection list is used to specify the year of the
      census enumeration for which you wish to update a Sub-District description.
      Until you select a year the selection list of provinces and 
      the selection list of census districts are not populated.
    </p>
    <p id="Province">
      The Province selection list is an alphabetical list of the
      provinces in the specified census.  It is filled in when you select
      a specific census year.  This selection list is used if you wish to
      limit the 
      displayed list of districts to a specific province.  Pre-Confederation
      censuses were administered independently in each of the colonies, and in 
      Canada East and Canada West.  For these censuses it is necessary to select
      the colony/province, and the application initially selects Canada West 
      (later re-named Ontario).
    </p>
    <p id="District">
      The District selection list is an alphabetical list of census
      districts, roughly equivalent to federal electoral ridings in 
      Post-Confederation censuses, and to counties in Pre-Confederation censuses.
      When you first select a post-Confederation census year this is initialized 
      with a list of all districts in the selected census.  For pre-Confederation
      censuses it is initialized with a list of all counties in Canada West
      (Ontario).
    </p>
    <p id="SubDistrict">
      The Sub-District selection list is an alphabetical list of census
      sub-districts within a district.  Generally they correspond to
      city wards, towns, or townships.
      This selection list is not populated until you select an individual
      district.
    </p>
    <p id="Division">
      The Division selection list does not appear until you select a Sub-District.
      If there is more than one division in the Sub-District, you must
      select the division before submitting the request.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have selected the desired division the dialogue should
      look something like this:
    </p>
    <img class="figure" SRC="ReqUpdatePages2.png" alt="Screenshot">
    <p id="Submit">
      The "Request Form" button is used to request that the edit page for the
      pages within the individual enumeration schedule of the identified
      sub-district be displayed.  This result can also be achieved by pressing
      the Enter key.
    </p>
    <p>When you submit the request a form displaying the contents of the portion
      of the Pages table for the requested enumeration division is displayed
      to permit you to edit the fields.
    </p>
    <img class="figure" SRC="PageForm.png" alt="Screenshot">
    <p>At the top and the bottom of the table of fields there is a line with three
      components:
    <ul>
      <li>An arrow pointing left.  This is a hyperlink to the preceding division
      	within the current district.  If you click on this hyperlink any
      	changes you have made to the page descriptions of the current division
      	are discarded.
      	You must click on the "Update Database" button at the bottom of the
      	form to apply changes.
      <li>A description of the current division being editted.
      <li>An arrow pointing right.  This is a hyperlink to the next division
      	within the current district.  If you click on this hyperlink any
      	changes you have made to the page descriptions of the current division
      	are discarded.
      	You must click on the "Update Database" button at the bottom of the
      	form to apply changes.
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The body of the form functions like a spreadsheet.
     <ul>
      <li>The forward and backward tab keys and the left and right arrow keys
  	change the selected cell in the table
      	to the left or the right. Motion wraps around at the left and right
      	edges of the table.
      <li>The up and down arrows change the selected cell in the table up or down
      	one row at a time.
      	Motion wraps around at the bottom and top of the table.
      <li>The enter (return) key changes the selected cell in the table down
      	one row at a time, rather than submitting the form as happens on
      	simpler pages.
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Note that you can hide any column by clicking on the column header with
      the mouse.  You can subsequently display the column by clicking on the
      narrow place holder in the column header.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Page number field is a sequential number from the first to
      the last page number defined for the current division.  It is not editable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count field contains the count of the number of individuals
      enumerated in the image of the original. 
      For most pages it is the number of rows on the original form.
      This is a decimal number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Transcriber field contains the user identifier of the individual 
      responsible for transcribing this page.  It is set to the first user
      to edit the page.  Once set the page is edittable only by that user,
      all other users, including the proofreader, can only comment on the 
      transcription.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Proofreader field contains the user identifier of the individual 
      who first entered comments on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Image field contains the URL of the original census image as
      it is available from the Library and Archives of Canada web-site.
      The first time a division is accessed this field is initialized 
      in each row from
      information in the Sub-District table, assuming the most common pattern
      for page images within the particular census.  
      The Sub-District table contains information on the
      first image URL in a division.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="button">View</span> button causes the browser window
      to be split in two so the
      image identified by the Image URL column is visible.  If the displayed
      image does not show the correct page from the original census then the
      backward and forward arrows (<span class="male"><u>&lt;---</u></span> and
      <span class="male"><u>---&gt;</u></span>) may be used to move through
      the image set.  As you change the displayed image in this way the
      value of the URL Image field in the table is changed so it always
      reflects the currently displayed image.
    </p>
    <img class="figure" SRC="PageFormWithImage.png" alt="Screenshot">
    <p>Further information on the use of each of the fields on this page
      is available by holding the cursor over the field or button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must click on the 
    <span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate Database</span> button at the bottom of the
      form to apply changes.  
      If you click on the left or right arrow hyperlinks to the preceding and
      following divisions in the web browser tool line
      any changes you made to the table are discarded.
      Observe that unlike simpler forms you cannot
      submit this form by pressing the Enter key, because this simply moves
      the selected cell down one row in the table.
    </p>
    <p>Once the database has been updated a page like the following is displayed.
    </p>
    <img class="figure" SRC="/database/PageUpdate.png" alt="Screenshot">
    <p>There are usually three buttons displayed:
    <ul>
      <li>The first button takes you back to the Pages table update request
      	page just as it was immediately before you clicked on 
      	<span class="button">Request Form</span>.
      	You can then select any other census division to work on.
      	Note that the last item in the trail of breadcrumbs in the page
      	header and trailer is a hyperlink to that same page.
      <li>If you were not editting the very first division in the district there
      	is a button to request editting the division preceding the division
      	you just editted.
      <li>If you were not editting the very last division in the district there
      	is a button to request editting the division following the division
      	you just editted.
    </ul>
