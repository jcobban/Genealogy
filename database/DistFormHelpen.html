      <h1>How to Update the Districts Table</h1>
      <p>
        The <b>Districts</b> table is intended to provide information on each 
        district of a census.
        The table is not complete because there is no automated way to collect all 
        of the necessary information.  The  
        <a href="/database/ReqUpdateDistsHelpen.html" target="help">
    	Request Edit Districts Table</a>
        page is used to manage the collection of the required information about
        each district.
      </p>
      <p>Further information on the use of each of the fields on this page
        is available by holding the mouse over the field or button.
      </p>
      <p>This page permits modifying the complete information maintained about each
        district in a portion of a census.  Generally this form provides access
        to the information on all districts within a province or state within a specific
        census year.
      </p>
      <p>The body of the form functions like a spreadsheet, particularly with
        respect to special key strokes.
      <ul>
        <li>The forward and backward tab keys, and the left and right arrow keys,
    	change the selected input field in the table
    	to the left or the right. Motion wraps around at the left and right
    	edges of the table.
        <li>The up and down arrows change the selected input field in the table 
    	up or down one row at a time.
    	Motion wraps around at the bottom and top of the table.
        <li>The "Home" key repositions the text cursor at the beginning of the
    	current input field.  The "End" key repositions the text cursor
    	after the last character in the current input field.
        <li>The "Ctl-Home" key combination selects the first input field in the row.
    	The "Ctl-End" key combination selects the last input field in the row.
        <li>The "Ctl-Z" key combination discards whatever you have typed in the
    	current input field, and restores the value to what it was when the
    	page was first displayed.
        <li>The "Enter" key changes the selected cell in the table down
    	one row at a time, rather than submitting the form as happens on
    	simpler forms.
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The District number field is a sequential number from the first to
        the last district number defined for the current census and province.  
        It is not editable.  There is no mechanism for adding or deleting
        districts through the web interface.
      </p>
      <p>The "Name" field contains the name of the district in English.
      </p>
      <p>The "Nom" field contains the name of the district in French.
      </p>
      <p>The "Province" column contains the two character postal abbreviation
        for the Province.  For the pre-confederation censuses this may be
      'CE' or 'CW' for Canada East and Canada West.
      </p>
      <p>The "Count" column displays the number of sub-districts defined in the
        Sub-Districts table for this district.  If this is zero then it is necessary
        to create the associated Sub-Districts for this District by clicking on
        the "Sub-Districts" button and entering data from the Library and
        Archives of Canada web-site. 
      </p>
      <p>The "%Done" column displays the percentage of the defined sub-districts
        that have been completed for this district.  Only completed sub-districts
        are ready for transcribers to contribute to.
      </p>
      <p>The <span class="button">Sub-Districts</span> button displays the
      <a href="/database/SubDistFormHelpen.html">form for editing information about
        the sub-districts and divisions in this district</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Further information on the use of each of the fields on this page
        is available by pressing the F1 key while the field is selected.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must click on the 
      <span class="button">Update Database</span> button at the bottom of the
        form to apply changes.  
        If you click on the left or right arrow hyperlinks to the preceding and
        following divisions in the line above the table
        any changes you made to the table are discarded.
        Observe that unlike simpler forms you cannot
        submit this form by pressing the Enter key, because this simply moves
        the selected cell down one row in the table.
      </p>
      <p>Once the database has been updated an 
      <a href="/database/DistUpdateHelpen.html">update status page</a> is displayed.
