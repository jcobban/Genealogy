       <h1>Census Administration:Districts: Help</h1>
      <p>This page is used to administer the districts into which the
      enumeration of a census was divided.  For pre-confederation censuses
      of Canada the districts were counties.  For post-confederation censuses
      they were federal electoral districts.
      </p>
      <p>You get to this administration page from the
      <a href="/database/ReqUpdateDistsHelpen.html">Census Administration:  
          Choose District</a> page.</p>
      <p>This page displays a portion of the table as identified by the
      request.  This normally contains information about 20 districts.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The unique identifier of the district within the census.
              This is usually, but not always, an integer.
        </li> 
        <li>The English name of the district.
        </li>
        <li>The French name of the district
        </li>
        <li>The abbreviation of the province containing this district.
        </li>
        <li>The number of Sub-Districts within this district.
        </li>
        <li>The percentage of the Sub-Districts for which the Sub-District
            entry has been completed.
        </li>
        <li>The total population of the District. This is obtained by
            summing the population of the component Sub-Districts.
        </li>
        <li>The percentage of the population which has been transcribed.
        </li>
        <li>If you are an administrator there is a button to delete the
            District.
        </li>
        <li>A button to display the information on the component Sub-Districts
            as described by 
            <a href="/database/SubDistFormHelpen.html">Census Administration: 
                Sub-Districts: Help</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Above and below the displayed table there is a line which displays
      information about the portion of the table that is displayed.
      At the left of each of these lines is an "arrow" pointing left. If you
      click on this arrow with the mouse, or click the "PgUp" button on
      the keyboard the previous page of information from this table is
      displayed.
      At the right of each of these lines is an "arrow" pointing right. If you
      click on this arrow with the mouse, or click the "PgDn" button on
      the keyboard the next page of information from this table is
      displayed.
      </p>
      <p>If you are an administrator at the bottom of the page is a button
      to apply any changes you have requested.  If you click on this button
      the changes are applied and the updated display is presented.
