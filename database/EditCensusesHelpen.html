    <h1>How to Update the Censuses Table</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>Censuses</b> table is intended to provide information on each 
      census for which transcription and indexing is supported.
    </p>
    <p>Further information on the use of each of the fields on this page
      is available by holding the mouse over the field or button.
    </p>
    <p>This page permits modifying the complete information about each census.  
    </p>
    <p>The body of the form functions like a spreadsheet, particularly with
      respect to special key strokes.
    <ul>
      <li>The forward and backward tab keys, and the left and right arrow keys,
  	change the selected input field in the table
  	to the left or the right. Motion wraps around at the left and right
  	edges of the table.
      <li>The up and down arrows change the selected input field in the table 
  	up or down one row at a time.
  	Motion wraps around at the bottom and top of the table.
      <li>The "Home" key repositions the text cursor at the beginning of the
  	current input field.  The "End" key repositions the text cursor
  	after the last character in the current input field.
      <li>The "Ctl-Home" key combination selects the first input field in the row.
  	The "Ctl-End" key combination selects the last input field in the row.
      <li>The "Ctl-Z" key combination discards whatever you have typed in the
  	current input field, and restores the value to what it was when the
  	page was first displayed.
      <li>The "Enter" key changes the selected cell in the table down
  	one row at a time, rather than submitting the form as happens on
  	simpler forms.
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The census identifier column is a combination of a domain identifier,
      usually an ISO 2-character country code, plus the year of the enumeration.
    </p>
    <p>The "Name" column contains the name of the census, normally starting with
      the enumeration year.
    </p>
    <p>The "Lines" column contains the normal maximum number of lines on the 
      main population form.
    </p>
    <p>The "Collective" column is a Y/N indicator of whether or not this entry
      is a conceptual collection of censuses.  For example prior to Canadian
      Confederation in 1867 each of the separate British colonies in North America
      had a separately administered census, as part of the British Imperial Census.
      Even Canada West (Upper Canada) and Canada East (Lower Canada) had separately
      administered enumerations, although they used a common form.
    </p>
    <p>The "Part of" column indicates for censuses that were administered at a 
      level below that of a separate nation or colony, the higher level political
      unit that they were a part of.  For example the 1861 Census of Canada West,
      with identifier 'CW1861' is considered part of the census of British North
      America, which is prolepticly identified as 'CA'.  
    </p>
    <p>The "Provinces" column displays a list of the 2-character identifiers of the
      provinces or states that are covered by a national census.
    </p>
    <p>The <span class="button">Delete</span> button deletes the specified census
      from the database.
    </p>
    <p>The <span class="button">Districts</span> button displays <a href="DistFormHelpen.html">the form for
      administering the enumeration districts into which the census is divided</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Further information on the use of each of the fields on this page
      is available by pressing the F1 key while the field is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must click on the 
    <span class="button">Update Database</span> button at the bottom of the
      form to apply changes.  
      If you click on the left or right arrow hyperlinks to the preceding and
      following divisions in the line above the table
      any changes you made to the table, except deletion of censuses, are discarded.
      Observe that unlike simpler forms you cannot
      submit this form by pressing the Enter key, because this simply moves
      the selected cell down one row in the table.
    </p>
    <p>Once the database has been updated the form is re-displayed showing the updates.
