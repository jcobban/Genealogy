      <h1>1861 Census: Nominal Search Help</h1>
    <p>This form permits you to specify the characteristics of individuals that
    you are looking for in the 1861 Census of Canada.
    <p>Once you have made all of your desired selections, click on the "Query"
    button centered at the top of the form.
    <p>The "Coverage" button performs a search of the database to report on which
    Districts and Sub-Districts are included in the current database.	
    <p class="label">Province</p>
    <p>The Census of 1861 covered the Colony of Canada, which was divided into
    two provinces: Canada East and Canada West, often referred to anachronistically as Lower Canada and Upper Canada, the names they used when they were separate colonies.  The choice, if desired, is made using the selection list.
    <p>At present there is no data for Canada East.
    <p class="label">District</p>
    <p>Each of the provinces was divided into Census Districts which corresponded
    to the cities and counties into which the provinces were divided.  
    <p>If a Province is selected then the District selection list is populated with
    an alphabetical list of the census Districts.
    <p class="label">Count</p>
    <p>The Count field permits specifying how many records are to be displayed at
    at a time.  The default is 20 records.
    <p class="label">Sub-District</p>
    <p>Each census District, generally the same as a County, was divided into 
    census Sub-Districts, each conforming generally to a City Ward, Town, 
    or Township.  The selection list of sub-districts is populated when you
    select a District.
    <p class="label">Division</p>
    <p>Larger census sub-districts were further divided into enumeration divisions
    or wards to try and balance out the workload for the enumerators.
    The selection list of divisions is populated when you select a sub-district.
    <p class="label">Page</p>
    <p>Each page of the population census contained room for 50 individuals.
    It is anticipated that the user will choose to search an individual page only
    for the situation when the entire page, all 50 individuals, are the desired
    target set.  Therefore selecting a specific page within a specific enumeration 
    division ignores the Count field so that all rows of the page are displayed
    and changes the default sort order to display the records in the order they
    appear in the original.
    <p class="label">Given Names</p>
    <p>This field is used to specify text which is matched against the given names
    of individuals in the database.  This search is done as a 
    case-insensitive pattern match, not a simple comparison. 
    <p>Specifying simple text, comprising letters and spaces, matches against
    any names containing that text.  "John" or "john" or "JOHN" will match
    "Johnathan" and "William John" as well as the simple "John".
    <p>The text may be a 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
    	regular expression</a>.
    There are too many options to enumerate here, but a few examples include:
    <ul>
        <li>If you want to match just the name "John", excluding names that include
    	"John" as part of them, enter "^John$".
        <li>Enumerators often use unusual spellings of names.  For example if you
    	to match names including both "Henry" and "Henery", enter "Hen.*ry".
    </ul>
    <p class="label">Surname</p>
    <p>This field is used to specify text to look for in the surname of individuals
    to look for.
    If the value contains only letters and spaces then only names that match
    exactly (except for case) are found.  Otherwise this
    uses the same pattern matching as described for Given Names.
    For example to match surnames starting with "McL..." and ending with ".n",
    such as "McLean", "McLain", "McLennan", or "McLellan" you could specify 
    "^McL.*n$".
    <p>The meaning of this field changes if the Soundex option is selected.
    <p class="label">Soundex</p>
    <p>The Soundex code has been used for decades to attempt to match names that
    sound similar.  For example it is used by police forces to perform a rough
    match for the names of drivers.  It is a problematic tool, as it
    is based upon the phonetics of British surnames.
    If you select this option along with a
    complete surname, not a pattern match, in the Surname field, then the search
    is made for surnames that "sound like" the given surname.  For example
    specifying Soundex together with "McLean" will match all of the surnames in
    the pattern match example under "Surname", but many other names as well, such
    "McCallum", "McAllan", "McClain", and "McWilliams". 
    <p class="label">Sex</p>
    <p>Select this option if you only want to look for male or female individuals.
    <p class="label">Marital Status</p>
    <p>Select this option if you wish to restrict the search based upon the
    marital status of the individuals.
    <p class="label">Occupation</p>
    <p>This option is used to search for individuals based upon their listed
    occupations.  This is again a pattern match.  For example searching for 
    "Labo[u]{0,1}rer" will match any occupation that contains either "Laborer" or
    "Labourer", including "Farm Labourer" and "R'y Laborer".
    <p class="label">Birth Place</p>
    <p>This option is used to search for individuals based upon where they were
    born.  This is a pattern match.  For example searching for "Canada" will 
    also match "Canada East", "Canada West", "Lower Canada", and "Upper Canada".
    <p class="label">Religion</p>
    <p>This option is used to search for individuals based upon their
    religious affiliation.  This is a pattern match.  For example searching for
    "Meth" will match any religion containing that string, including 
    "Wesleyan Methodist", "C. Meth.", "New Connexion Methodist", 
    and "Methodist Episcopal".
    <p class="label">Residence</p>
    <p>This option is used to search for individuals based upon the text in the
    column labeled "Residence if out of bounds".  This is a pattern match.  This
    field is understandably very infrequently used by the enumerators since it is
    defined for members of a family who are not currently residing with their
    family.  To minimize wasting this column I have added information from
    schedule B about the address of the property on the line for the head of
    household.  This information is enclosed in square brackets to indicate that
    it is not present in the original population census image.  Note that if you
    wish to search for lines containing square brackets you have to escape them
    because square brackets are part of the regular expression language.  For
    example to search for records where the Residence field contains "[con 2" you
    need to specify "\[con 2" in this option.
    <p class="label">Birth Year &amp; Range</p>
    <p>The Birth Year and Range fields are used to search for individuals based
    upon their approximate birth year calculated from their age at their
    next birthday after the census in spring 1861.
