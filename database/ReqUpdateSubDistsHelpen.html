        <h1>Census Sub-District Table Help</h1>
    <p>Each district of a census of Canada is divided into sub-districts.
    Generally a sub-district corresponds to a township, town, large village, or a ward in a city.
    <p>For censuses prior to 1911
    if the workload of collecting the census data was anticipated to exceed the
    capacity of a single enumerator, then the sub-district was divided into
    divisions.  In the 1911 census multiple sub-districts were created instead.
    <p>All of the information that the application requires to know about a
    sub-district (or division) is collected in the Sub-District Table.
    This includes:
      <ul>
        <li>The 6 character identifier of the census.  This consists of the
    	2 character country code, 'CA' for Canada, 
    	and the 4 digit enumeration year.
        <li>The numeric identifier of the district of which the sub-district
    	is a part. 
        <li>The identifier of the sub-district within the district.  For some
    	censuses (1851, 1861, 1906, 1911) this is a number.  For others it
    	is an alphabetic code.
        <li>The division number if the sub-district is divided into divisions.
    	There is a separate record in this table for each division.
        <li>The name of the sub-district.
        <li>The number of pages in the population (enumeration of the living)
    	schedule.
        <li>The first page number in the division.  In most cases this is 1.
    	However in the 1851 and 1861 censuses the pages were not 
    	consistently numbered by the enumerators, and the pages were 
    	subsequently numbered sequentially through the entire sub-district
    	when the original documents were microfilmed (and the originals
    	destroyed!).
        <li>The page increment within the division.  In a few cases when the
    	1851 and 1861 census pages were numbered, during the microfilming
    	process, the technician incremented the page number twice for
    	each leaf of the schedule of the living because information about
    	the individuals was recorded on both the recto and the verson of
    	each leaf.  In this case the application has to know that only the
    	odd page numbers are used to identify the page[s] containing
    	information on an individual.
        <li>The total number of individuals in the division.  This is used
    	by the web pages that track the progress of the transcription.
        <li>Library &amp; Archives of Canada (LAC) microfilm reel identifier.
        <li>Church of Latter Day Saints (LDS) Family History Library (FHL) 
    	microfilm reel number.
        <li>The "Image Base", and "Relative Frame" fields identify the crucial
    	numeric values that are used to compute the Uniform Record Locator
    	(URL) of the image of the first page of the population schedule.
    	The exact meaning of these two fields depends upon the census.
        <li>The number of images for this division on the web site.
      </ul
    </p>
    <p>The "Update SubDist Table" application requires that you uniquely
    identify the district containing the sub-district (and division) for which
    you wish to correct information.  Once you have made that selection the
    application displays the portion of the table including 
    all of the sub-districts (and divisions) in the selected division.
    <p>To identify the district you identify the enumeration year, and district.
    The pre-Confederation censuses were administered separately in each of the
    colonies, and when the Dominion Bureau of Statistics (predecessor of
    Statistics Canada) organized the records for those censuses, it assigned
    separate sets of district numbers for each of the colonies.  So for the
    pre-Confederation censuses you must also specify the colony (province) in
    which the district is located.  For the post-Confederation censuses
    specifying the province is optional, although it limits the set of
    districts displayed.
    <p>Once you have selected the district, click on the 
    <span class="button">Request Form</span> button.
    The application displays the information on all of the sub-districts and
    divisions in the requested district in a 
    <a href="SubDistFormHelpen.html">tabular form</a>
    that can be updated like a spreadsheet.
