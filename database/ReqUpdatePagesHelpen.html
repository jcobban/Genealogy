        <h1>Census Page Table Help</h1>
    <p>Each census of Canada is divided into enumeration divisions.
    The enumeration division is the lowest administrative level of the
    census and is assigned to an individual enumerator to complete.
    Each division includes one or more pages.  The Census Page table
    contains the information maintained for each individual page of
    each census.
    <p>Each Page entry includes:
      <ul>
        <li>The 6 character identifier of the census.  Normally this consists of the
    	2 character country code, 'CA' for Canada, 
    	and the 4 digit enumeration year.  However for the
    	pre-confederation censuses, which were administered separately in
    	each of the colonies, the country code is replaced by a
    	two character abbreviation for the colony, for example 'CW' for
    	Canada West (previously called Upper Canada, and subsequently Ontario).
        <li>The numeric identifier of the district.  This is almost always
    	a sequential integer, however in a couple of cases the district
    	number includes a fractional component (Â½ expressed as .5).
        <li>The numeric or alphabetic identification code for the Sub-District,
    	usually a township, town, large village, or city ward.
        <li>The division number of the Sub-District is divided into enumeration
    	divisions to split the enumerators' workload.
        <li>The numeric page number.
        <li>The number of individuals enumerated on the original page.
    	Initially this defaults to the number of lines on the form, but it
    	is adjusted when the page is transcribed.
        <li>The URL of the associated image if it is available on the web.
        <li>The user identifier of the transcriber.
        <li>The user identifier of the proof-reader.
      </ul>

    <p>The application requires that you uniquely
    identify the census,
    the province, the district number, the sub-district identifier,
    and if necessary the division number.
    Once you have made that selection the
    application displays the portion of the Division Page table including 
    all of the pages in the selected division.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have made your selection, click on the 
    <span class="button">Request Form</span> button.
    The application displays the information on all of the pages
    in the requested division in a 
    <a href="PageFormHelpen.html">tabular form</a>
    that can be updated like a spreadsheet.
