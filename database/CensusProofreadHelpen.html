    <h1>Census Proofread Help</h1>
      <p>This page is presented if you are authorized to update 
        Census transcriptions but are not the first user to transcribe
        a specific page of a census.  In this case any changes which you 
        make to the values of fields are recorded as field notes.  This page
        presents a list of all of the fields that you have changed and
        offers the ability for you to comment on why you made the
        changes.
      </p>
      <p>If a problem was encountered with the parameters identifying
        the page that you were updating then an error mesage is displayed.
      </p>

      <p>The identification of the specific page you are proofreading
        is identified.
      </p>
      <p><span class="button">Update Next Page 99 in ...</span> takes you
        directly to the page for proofreading the next page within the
        current enumeration division.  The keyboard shortcut for this
        is Ctrl-N.
      </p>
      <p><span class="button">Update Previous Page 99 in ...</span>
        takes you directly to the page for proofreading the preceding page 
        within the current enumeration division.  The keyboard shortcut
        for this is Ctrl-P.
      </p>
      <p><span class="button">Update</span> records the changes you have
        made as field comments. These field comments will be displayed
        whenever a user views the census page.  The keyboard shortcut
        for this is Ctrl-U.  Note that pressing the Enter key while
        entering data into an explanation field also applies the updates.
      </p>
      <p><span class="button">Close</span> discards the changes you
        have made.  The keyboard shortcut for this is Ctrl-C.
      </p>
      <p>The changes you have made to the census transcription are
        displayed in a tabular form.  You can enter an explanation
        for why you believe this is a better field value.
