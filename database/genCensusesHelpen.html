  <h1>Censuses of Canada: Help</h1>
  <p>This page provides a list of services relating to the various censuses of
  Canada that are available.  Some of these services are provided by this web site
  and others by other free web sites.
  </p>
  <p>While services that permit viewing census data are available to all
  visitors, there are additional services that permit you to contribute to
  the expansion of free census searches.  All of the census searches that are
  implemented on this web-site can be contributed to by any registered user.
  </p>
  <p>There are individual database tables for each of the
  <a href="QueryDetail1851Helpen.html">1851</a>, 
  <a href="QueryDetail1861Helpen.html">1861</a>, 
  <a href="QueryDetail1871Helpen.html">1871</a>, 
  <a href="QueryDetail1881Helpen.html">1881</a>, 
  <a href="QueryDetail1891Helpen.html">1891</a>, 
  <a href="QueryDetail1901Helpen.html">1901</a>, 
  <a href="QueryDetail1906Helpen.html">1906</a>, 
  <a href="QueryDetail1911Helpen.html">1911</a>,  
  <a href="QueryDetail1916Helpen.html">1916</a>, and
  <a href="QueryDetail1921Helpen.html">1921</a>
  censuses of Canada, which record all or almost all
  of the the values recorded in the individual enumeration forms of each of
  the censuses.  For the post-confederation (1867) censuses that is schedule 1.
  There is also an option to perform a nominal search of
  <a href="QueryDetailAllHelpen.html">All</a> censuses of Canada at once. 
  </p>
  <p>To support the application there are three additional tables:
  <ul>
      <li>The <a href="ReqUpdateDistsHelpen.html">District table</a> 
  	contains information about the districts into which
  	each census was divided.  For the pre-confederation (1867) censuses
  	a District is the same as a County.  Indeed the 1851 census was
  	delayed until 1852 precisely because in 1851 the counties
  	in Canada West (Ontario, formerly Upper Canada) were in the
  	process of being organized as a result of the constitutional changes
  	introduced as a result of the Durham Report.  However for the
  	post-confederation censuses the enumeration districts are based upon
  	the electoral districts (called ridings in Canada).
      <li>The <a href="ReqUpdateSubDistsHelpen.html">
  	Sub-District table</a> 
  	contains information about each of the
  	enumeration sub-districts into which the Districts were divided.
  	Generally a Sub-District corresponds to a township, town, large village,
  	or city ward.  If the population of a Sub-District was such as
  	to require being divided in order to keep the enumerator's workload
  	down, then the Sub-District was divided into Divisions.  Each
  	division has a separate row in this table.
      <li>The <a href="ReqUpdatePagesHelpen.html">Page table</a> 
  	contains information about each individual page in the
  	individual enumeration schedule of every census.  
  	This table is therefore conceptually
  	extremely large.  However it is not populated for a given division
  	until the first page in that division is transcribed.  Each entry
  	in the page table tracks information including
  	how many individuals are recorded on the page, and the URL of the
  	image of the original page, if that image is available on the web
  	from a free source (usually the Library and Archives of Canada web
  	site).
