    <h1>Censuses of Canada: Help</h1>
    <p>This page provides a list of services relating to the various
      censuses of Canada that are available.  Some of these services
      are provided by this web site and others by other free web sites.
    </p>
    <p>There are two motivations for maintaining this separate
      transcription:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>This transcription is independent of other transcriptions and
        therefore will have different errors in transcription.  Almost
        all other sites share a single transcription organized by the
        Church of Latter Day Saints (LDS) Family History Library (FHL) 
        and financed in part by Ancestry.com.  This includes the 
        <a href="https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/census/Pages/census.aspx">
            Library and Archives of Canada</a>.
        The only other independent transcriptions I am aware of are
        <a href="http://geneofun.on.ca/ontariocensus/">OntarioGenWeb's Census Project</a> and 
        <a href="http://automatedgenealogy.com/">Automated Genealogy</a>.
      <li>The family tree on this site identifies individual pages
        by the identification scheme used by the Dominion Bureau of
        Statistics for post-Confederation censuses, which was also
        retrofitted to the pre-Confederation censuses in the 1950s.  This
        requires organizing the transcription based upon that
        identification scheme.
    </ol>
    <p>This service supports transcribing every column on the original
      forms.  For each column the value entered by the transcriber is
      validated against the guidelines for the column and if not meeting
      those guidelines the entered value is highlighted in 
      <span style="color: red;">red</span>.  Many columns also have
      support for expanding abbreviations to speed up data entry.  These
      abbreviations are explained in the popup help balloons for each
      column.
    </p>
    <p>Columns which in the original represented a yes/no indicator about
      the individual are filled in with the gender of the individual.
      This permits coalescing columns which in the pre-Confederation
      censuses had separate columns for tracking by gender.  This is 
      extended to similar columns in post-Confederation censuses.  For
      example in the Pre-Confederation censuses there were separate columns
      for school attendance by gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pre-Confederation censuses did not include a column for
      associating members of a single household, only for describing
      residences.  As a consequence the LDS transcription does not
      organize its response by household.  This transcription emulates
      the post-Confederation family column.
    </p>
    <p>In each form you can hide individual columns by clicking on the
      column header.  There is also a 
      <span class="button">Show Important</span> button that hides fields
      that are not part of the identification of the individual.
    </p>
    <p>While services that permit viewing census data are available to all
      visitors, there are additional services that permit you to
      contribute to the expansion of free census searches. Any registered 
      user can contribute to any of the census searches that are
      implemented on this web-site .
    </p>
    <p>There are individual database tables for each of the
        <a href="QueryDetail1851Helpen.html">1851</a>, 
        <a href="QueryDetail1861Helpen.html">1861</a>, 
        <a href="QueryDetail1871Helpen.html">1871</a>, 
        <a href="QueryDetail1881Helpen.html">1881</a>, 
        <a href="QueryDetail1891Helpen.html">1891</a>, 
        <a href="QueryDetail1901Helpen.html">1901</a>, 
        <a href="QueryDetail1906Helpen.html">1906</a>, 
        <a href="QueryDetail1911Helpen.html">1911</a>,  
        <a href="QueryDetail1916Helpen.html">1916</a>, and
        <a href="QueryDetail1921Helpen.html">1921</a>
      censuses of Canada, which record all or almost all of the 
      values recorded in the individual enumeration forms of each of
      the censuses.  For the post-confederation (1867) censuses that
      is schedule 1.
      There is also an option to perform a nominal search of
    <a href="QueryDetailAllHelpen.html">All</a> censuses of Canada at once. 
    </p>
    <p>To support the application there are three additional tables:
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="ReqUpdateDistsHelpen.html">District table</a> 
      	contains information about the districts into which
      	each census was divided.  For the pre-confederation (1867) censuses
      	a District is the same as a County.  Indeed the 1851 census was
      	delayed until 1852 precisely because in 1851 the counties
      	in Canada West (Ontario, formerly Upper Canada) were in the
      	process of being organized as a result of the constitutional changes
      	introduced as a result of the Durham Report.  However for the
      	post-confederation censuses the enumeration districts are based upon
      	the electoral districts (called ridings in Canada).
        <li>The <a href="ReqUpdateSubDistsHelpen.html">
      	Sub-District table</a> 
      	contains information about each of the
      	enumeration sub-districts into which the Districts were divided.
      	Generally a Sub-District corresponds to a township, town, large village,
      	or city ward.  If the population of a Sub-District was such as
      	to require being divided in order to keep the enumerator's workload
      	down, then the Sub-District was divided into Divisions.  Each
      	division has a separate row in this table.
      <li>The <a href="ReqUpdatePagesHelpen.html">Page table</a> 
      	contains information about each individual page in the
      	individual enumeration schedule of every census.  
      	This table is therefore conceptually
      	extremely large.  However it is not populated for a given division
      	until the first page in that division is transcribed.  Each entry
      	in the page table tracks information including
      	how many individuals are recorded on the page, and the URL of the
      	image of the original page, if that image is available on the web
      	from a free source (usually the Library and Archives of Canada web
      	site).
