      <h1>1906 Census: Transcription Help</h1>
      <p>This form permits you to:
      <ul>
        <li>View every field in the transcription of a page of the
    	1906 Census of the Prairie Provinces of Canada even if you are
    	just visiting the site.
        <li>Transcribe a page of the 1906 Census of the Prairie Provinces
    	of Canada.
        <li>Proofread a page of the transcription.
        <li>Contribute field level notes.
      </ul>
      <p>If you are not signed on with authorization to update the census database
    then the information on this page is read-only.
      <h2>Header Information</h2>
      <p>The complete identification of the page is displayed centered at the top
    of the form. This is in the form:
      <p class="label">
        dist 99 Countyname, subdist 99 Subdistrict Name, page 9
      </p>
      <p>At the left margin, except if you are on the first page of
    a census division, there is an arrow pointing left.  Clicking
    on this arrow takes you to the preceding page in the division.
    At the right margin,
    except if you are on the last page of a census division, there is an
    arrow pointing right.  Clicking on this arrow takes you to the next page
    in the division.
      <p>The next line identifies the transcriber of this page.  If the page has
    not yet been transcribed your user name is inserted here, however you
    will only become the transcriber for the page if you update the page.
      <p>If the page has been transcribed, and someone has volunteered to
    proofread the page, then the next line identifies the proofreader.
      <p>The next line of the form normally contains a
      <span class="button">Display&nbsp;Original&nbsp;Census&nbsp;<u>I</u>mage</span> button.
    When you click on this button the browser window is split into two halves,
    and the original census image on the Library and Archives of Canada web site
    is displayed in the right-hand half of the window.
    The keyboard shortcut for this button is Alt-I. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="figure" src="CensusForm1851WithImage.png" alt="Screenshot">
      </p>
      <p>It is possible that the URL of the image associated with page in the
    database is incorrect.  In this case you can use the backward and forward
    links in the image display window to move through the image set for the
    census until you find the correct image.  If you are signed on and authorized
    to update this page then when you update the census page the associated
    image URL is corrected so that subsequent visitors will see the correct
    image.
      </p>
      <p>If you are signed on and authorized to update the database 
    this is followed by a
      <span class="button"><u>C</u>orrect&nbsp;Image&nbsp;URL</span> button.  Click on this button
    to request the option to correct the Image URL if the
    existing URL recorded for this page is incorrect.  
    The keyboard shortcut for this button is Alt-C.  
      <p>If the database does not contain the
    image URL for this page, or if you have requested the option to correct the
    image URL, then this line of the form has an input field for providing
    the image URL.  For example:
      <p>
        <img SRC="EnterImageUrl.png" alt="Enter URL of Image">
      <p>If you are signed on and authorized to update the database 
    this is followed by a
      <span class="button">Match&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Tree&nbsp;Citations</span> button.  Click on this button
    to request a search of the family tree database for individuals that have
    citations to this page.  These individuals are compared by name, gender, and
    age to the individuals on this page, and if there is a good enough match
    a linkage is established from the corresponding row of the census to the
    family tree.
      <h2>Body of the Page</h2>
      <p>The bulk of the web page consists of a fill-in-the-blanks form which
    is organized to model the layout of the original image, even to bold horizontal
    lines after each 5th row of the form.  This form contains a text input field
    for each field in the original form.  Most fields have some auto-completion
    features so you do not have to type the complete value, just start an
    abbreviation and when you tab out of the field it will be completed.  For
    additional details on how to fill in any field press the F1 key while in the
    field.
      <p>The columns of this form represent:
      <ol>
        <li>The line number on the original form, from 1 to 40.  Note that there
    	is an <span class="button">Add a Row</span> button 
    	at the bottom of the form to add an extra line if the
    	enumerator squeezed one in.
        <li>The family number.  Note that the value you enter is replicated into
    	subsequent rows, so you only need to enter this on the first line of
    	a family.
        <li>The surname field is used to specify the surname of each individual.
    	This value is replicated into subsequent rows, so you only need to
    	enter this on the head of household.
    	A left square bracket, "[", entered in this field is expanded to
    	"[Blank]" and all of the other fields in this row are set to empty.
    	Do this where the enumerator left a blank line in the middle of
    	a page.
    	Entering "[d" in this field is expanded to
    	"[Delete]" and all of the other fields in this row and all subsequent
    	rows are set to empty.  This is done where the original page has 
    	fewer than the standard number of entries, in particular on the last
    	page of an enumeration division.
        <li>Given names.
        <li>Relation to head of household.
        <li>Sex. Specify M or F.
        <li>Marital Status.
        <li>Age.
        <li>Birth Year.
        <li>Birth Place.
        <li>Year of Immigration, if not born in Canada.
        <li>Post Office name.
        <li>The section number of the residence.  
        <li>The township number of the section.  
        <li>The range number of the township.  
        <li>The meridian number of the range.
        <li>The number of horses. 
        <li>The number of milch cows. 
        <li>The number of other cattle. 
        <li>The number of sheep. 
        <li>The number of pigs. 
        <li>Remarks by the enumerator, appearing in the margin after
    	the last column.  
    	Remarks by the transcriber should be identified by square brackets.
        <li>Family Tree (FT) linkage column.  If this is a 
    	<span class="button">Show</span> button then a linkage to the family
    	tree has been entered into the database.  Clicking on the 
    	<span class="button">Show</span> button opens a new window with
    	the information about the individual as recorded in the family tree.
    	If this is a 
    	<span class="button">Find</span> button then clicking on the
    	button performs a search of the family tree for individuals who
    	have names and birth years which indicate they may be 
    	the individual enumerated on this line.  A dialog is displayed
    	with a list of potential matches to choose from.
      </ol>
      <p>Because of the number of columns in this form you may not be able
    to see all of the columns at the same time.  Since not all of the columns may
    be important to you, you can hide any column by using the mouse to click on
    the column header cell.  This shrinks the column to a minimum width.  If you
    click on the now very narrow column header cell again the column is restored.
      <h2>Footer Information</h2>
      <p>There are three buttons at the bottom of the form:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate Database</span>.
    	Clicking on this button applies the changes to the database.
    	Note that the 'U' in the name is underlined as a reminder that
    	the keyboard shortcut alt-U can be used to submit the update,
    	saving the need to scroll the page down to see this button.
    	For compatibility with spread-sheet programs you may also use
    	ctrl-S to submit the update.
        <li><span class="button">Reset to Defaults</span>. 
    	Clicking on this button resets all of the fields
    	in the form to their default values.  For most fields this is blank.
        <li><span class="button">Add a Row</span>.
    	If the enumerator squeezed an extra line in at the bottom
    	of the form, sometimes to avoid splitting a family across a page
    	boundary, clicking on this button adds an extra input line to the
    	form.
      </ul>
      <p>The complete identification of the page is repeated centered at the bottom
    of the form. 
      <p>At the left margin, except if you are on the first page of
    a census division, there is an arrow pointing left.  Clicking
    on this arrow takes you to the preceding page in the division.
    At the right margin,
    except if you are on the last page of a census division, there is an
    arrow pointing right.  Clicking on this arrow takes you to the next page
    in the division.
