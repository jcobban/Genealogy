    <h1>1906 Census: Nominal Search Help</h1>
  <p>This form permits you to specify the characteristics of individuals that
  you are looking for in the 1906 Census of Canada.
  <p>Once you have made all of your desired selections, click on the "Query"
  button centered at the top of the form.	
  <p>The "Coverage" button performs a search of the database to report on which
  Districts and Sub-Districts are included in the current database.	
  <p class="label">Province</p>
  <p>The Census of 1906 covered the new Prairie Provinces of Canada, 
  which included
  Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.
  If you wish to limit the search to a specific province the choice is made
  using the selection list.
  <p class="label">District</p>
  <p>The country was divided into Census Districts which corresponded
  approximately to electoral districts or ridings.
  Although some of these Districts have the same name as Counties, they
  do not generally have the same boundaries as the Counties with the same name.
  <p>Initially this selection list includes all Districts in the country.
  If a Province is selected then the District selection list is populated with
  an alphabetical list of the census Districts in that Province.
  <p class="label">Count</p>
  <p>The Count field permits specifying how many records are to be displayed at
  at a time.  The default is 20 records.
  <p class="label">Sub-District</p>
  <p>Each census District, was divided into 
  census Sub-Districts, 
  The selection list of sub-districts is populated when you
  select a District.
  In the 1906 census sub-districts represented individual enumeration divisions,
  so there are frequently multiple sub-districts for a single township, town, 
  or city ward.  In an annoying move the central administration of the Census
  merged multiple enumeration divisions within a single District if those
  divisions shared an enumerator.  As a result many urban Sub-Districts have
  multiple page sequences corresponding to the separate enumeration divisions. 
  <p class="label">Page</p>
  <p>Each page of the population census contained room for 50 individuals.
  It is anticipated that the user will choose to search an individual page only
  for the situation when the entire page, all 50 individuals, are the desired
  target set.  Therefore selecting a specific page within a specific enumeration 
  division ignores the Count field so that all rows of the page are displayed
  and changes the default sort order to display the records in the order they
  appear in the original.
  <p>As mentioned above in an annoying move the central administration of the 
  Census
  merged multiple enumeration divisions within a single District if those
  divisions shared an enumerator.  As a result many urban Sub-Districts have
  multiple page sequences corresponding to the separate enumeration divisions. 
  <p class="label">Given Names</p>
  <p>This field is used to specify text which is matched against the given names
  of individuals in the database.  This search is done as a 
  case-insensitive pattern match, not a simple comparison. 
  <p>Specifying simple text, comprising letters and spaces, matches against
  any names containing that text.  "John" or "john" or "JOHN" will match
  "Johnathan" and "William John" as well as the simple "John".
  <p>The text may be a 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
  	regular expression</a>.
  There are too many options to enumerate here, but a few examples include:
  <ul>
      <li>If you want to match just the name "John", excluding names that include
  	"John" as part of them, enter "^John$".
      <li>Enumerators often use unusual spellings of names.  For example if you
  	to match names including both "Henry" and "Henery", enter "Hen.*ry".
  </ul>
  <p class="label">Surname</p>
  <p>This field is used to specify text to look for in the surname of individuals.
  If the value contains only letters and spaces then only names that match
  exactly (except for case) are found.  Otherwise this
  uses the same pattern matching as described for Given Names.
  For example to match surnames starting with "McL..." and ending with ".n",
  such as "McLean", "McLain", "McLennan", or "McLellan" you could specify 
  "^McL.*n$".
  <p>The meaning of this field changes if the Soundex option is selected.
  <p class="label">Soundex</p>
  <p>The Soundex code has been used for decades to attempt to match names that
  sound similar.  For example it is used by police forces to perform a rough
  match for the names of drivers.  It is a problematic tool, as it
  is based upon the phonetics of British surnames.
  If you select this option along with a
  complete surname, not a pattern match, in the Surname field, then the search
  is made for surnames that "sound like" the given surname.  For example
  specifying Soundex together with "McLean" will match all of the surnames in
  the pattern match example under "Surname", but many other names as well, such
  "McCallum", "McAllan", "McClain", and "McWilliams". 
  <p class="label">Sex</p>
  <p>Select this option if you only want to look for male or female individuals.
  <p class="label">Marital Status</p>
  <p>Select this option if you wish to restrict the search based upon the
  marital status of the individuals.
  <p class="label">Birth Place</p>
  <p>This option is used to search for individuals based upon where they were
  born.  This is a pattern match.  For example searching for "Canada" will 
  also match "Canada East", "Canada West", "Lower Canada", and "Upper Canada".
  <p class="label">Birth Year &amp; Range</p>
  <p>The Birth Year and Range fields are used to search for individuals based
  upon their approximate birth year based upon their age at the time of the census
  in spring 1906.
