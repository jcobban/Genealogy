    <h1>Census: Match Citations Help</h1>
    <p>This page reports the results of attempting to match citations from
  the family tree to the current page of the census.
    <p>The script searches for all citations from individuals to the page
  identified by year of census, province for pre-confederation censuses, district
  number, sub-district identifier, division if applicable, and page number.
  Each individual with such a citation should correspond to an individual on
  this page.  An attempt is made to match the individual by name, including
  married name if applicable, gender, and approximate age.  If a match is
  found it is reported on this page, and the database record for the associated
  line is updated to contain a linkage to the family tree record.
    <p>You can close this page at any time after it is displayed, as there are
  no further actions to perform.
    <p>When you look back at the census form for the associated page you will
  observe that the <span class="button">Find</span> button for each identified
  match has been changed to a <span class="button">Show</span> button, and if
  you click on it the associated family tree individual is displayed in a new
  tab or window.
