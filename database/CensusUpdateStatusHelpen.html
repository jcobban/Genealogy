      <h1>Census Transcription Status: Census Level Help</h1>
      <p>This page displays a high-level summary of progress on the
    transcription of a particular census of Canada, usually for a specific
    province.  It displays one row for each census district:
      <p>For each district it displays:
      <ol>
        <li>The district number.  For pre-confederation censuses this is within
    	the province, as the census was administered independently in each
    	province or colony.
        <li>The name of the district.
        <li>The two character postal abbreviation for the province or territory
    	containing the district.
        <li>The number of individuals transcribed so far within the district.
    	Note that this includes partially transcribed individuals.
        <li>The total number of individuals enumerated within the district.
        <li>The percentage completion.  This field is color-coded running from dark
    	red for no work done so far through to bright green for 100% completion.
        <li>A details button to display 
    	<a href="/database/CensusUpdateStatusDistHelpen.html">the status of each
    	subdistrict and enumeration division within the district</a>.
        <li>A button to display an index of the 
    	<a href="/database/QuerySurnamesTopHelpen.html">surnames of the individuals</a>
    	already transcribed within the district.  This is particular useful in
    	finding desired individuals because frequently surnames are either
    	misspelled by the original enumerator or the handwriting of the
    	enumerator has been mis-interpreted by the transcriber.
      </ol>
      <p>At the bottom of the table the total number of individuals transcribed
        in this census is displayed, along with the total number of individuals
        enumerated within the districts for which some work has been done, and
        the color-coded percentage completion for the set of districts covered.
      </p>
      <p>Just above the table of districts there is a link pointing to the left
        which permits browsing to the previous portion of the census database, 
        and a link pointing to the right which permits browsing to the next
        portion of the database.  If you hold the mouse over either of these
        links information is displayed about exactly which portion of the census
        will be displayed if you follow the link.  Within a particular census
        the provinces are arranged alphabetically
