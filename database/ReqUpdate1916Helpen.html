        <h1>1916 Census of Canada: Update: Help</h1>
    <p>This form is used to identify a specific page of the 1916 census of
    the prairie provinces of Canada to be transcribed,
    or to update the transcription.
    <p>The 1916 census was limited to
    Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.
    <p>The census is divided into enumeration districts.
    Each district generally
    corresponds to a federal electoral district (called a riding in Canada),
    which were very roughly similar in population based upon the preceding
    census.  Each district was uniquely numbered.  For this census the district
    numbers were assigned alphabetically within each province.
    <p>Each enumeration district was subdivided into sub-districts
    identified numerically. 
    <p>Where the population was particularly dense, mainly in cities, the
    sub-district was divided into divisions.  These divisions are sometimes
    identified numerically, and sometimes by letters of the alphabet.
    <p>Within the enumeration division pages are identified numerically.
    <p>The application requires that you:
    <ol>
        <li>Optionally identify the province to restrict the displayed list
    	of districts (presented alphabetically by district name).
        <li>Identify the district by selecting from the displayed list.
        <li>Select the sub-district from the list displayed once you have
    	selected a district.
        <li>If the sub-district is divided into multiple divisions
    	to resolve the issue described above, a selection
    	list is presented from which you must select a division.
        <li>Select the page from the selection list of page numbers that is
    	presented once you have selected the enumeration division.
    </ol>
    <p>Once you have selected the page, click on the "Request Form" button.
    The application displays a 
    <a href="CensusForm1916Helpen.html">data entry form</a>
    that can be updated like a spreadsheet.
    This form matches the layout of the
    original census image.  If the page has already been transcribed this form
    contains the current contents of the transcription.
    <p>Immediately following the "Request Form" button there is a 
    "Progress Display" button.  Click on this to display an
    <a href="CensusUpdateStatusHelpen.html">overview of the transcription status
    </a> of the 1916 census.  This shows the district by district progress of
    the transcription effort.  It also provides an alternate method to identify
    a page to view, transcribe, or update.
