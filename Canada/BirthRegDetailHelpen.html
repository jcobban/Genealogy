      <h1>Birth Registration Details: Help
      </h1>
    <p>The associated panel permits updating the database of
    Ontario Birth Registrations.
    <p><span class='label'>Navigation:</span>
    There are three navigation buttons at the top of the page:
    <ul>
        <li>Clicking on <span class='button'><u>P</u>revious</span> 
    	displays the registration with the next lower registration
    	number within the current year.
    	You may also use the keyboard shortcut Alt-P.
        <li>Clicking on<span class='button'><u>N</u>ext</span> 
    	displays the registration with the next higher registration
    	number within the current year.
    	You may also use the keyboard shortcut Alt-N.
        <li>Clicking on<span class='button'>New <u>Q</u>uery</span> 
    	displays the <a href='BirthRegQueryHelpen.html'>Birth Registration
    	Query</a> dialog.
    	You may also use the keyboard shortcut Alt-Q.
    </ul>
    <p><span class='label'>Identification:</span>
    This row of the display identifies the specific registration
    by specifying the year of 
    registration and the number assigned by the Ontario Registrar when the records
    were indexed.
    <p><span class='label'>Registration: County:</span>
    This is a selection listing all of the counties and districts in Ontario.
    For an existing record the county specified in that record is selected.
    For a new record the county specified in the existing record with the
    highest registration number less than the current record is selected.
    This is because registrations from a particular county, or district, always
    have contiguous registration numbers.
    <p><span class='label'>
    Registration: Township:
    </span>
    This is usually a selection list of all of the villages, towns, townships, 
    and cities within the county that at some period had a clerk collecting
    registrations.  If a county is not selected 
    or if the township name is misspelled in the existing record 
    then this is a text input field.
    For an existing record the township specified in that record is selected.
    For a new record the township specified in the existing record with the
    highest registration number less than the current record is selected.
    This is because registrations from a particular clerk generally
    have contiguous registration numbers.
    Clicking on this button performs the query.  This may also be requested by
    pressing the Enter key while the input focus is in a text field.
    <p><span class='label'>Given Name:</span>

    </p>
    <p><span class='label'>Parents Married</span>

    whether the child is legitimate or not.  This is a checkbox.
    </p>

    as documented by the popup help balloon.
    </p>
    <p><span class='label'>Link:</span>
    <p>
    If this registration has been cited in the family tree as documentation for
    a birth, then a hyperlink is provided to the family tree page for the
    child.  Otherwise if possible a selection list of entries in the family
    tree that resemble this birth are displayed so you can choose one.  Choosing
    an entry adds a citation to this birth registration onto the child's record
    in the family tree.
