      <h1>Edit Counties: Help
      </h1>
      <p>This page presents a list of all of the counties in a province
        and permits adding, deleting, and modifying the descriptions of counties.
        For each county there is a row in the table containing:
      <ul>
    	<li>A three-character mnemonic code used by other tables to
    	    identify a county.  This field is read-only except on a line
    	    for adding a new county.
    	<li>The full name of the county.
    	<li>The year the county came into existence as an administrative
    	    entity.  For Ontario this is almost always 1852.  Prior to that
    	    some counties existed on the map, but had no administrative
    	    organization.
    	<li>The year the county ceased to operate as an administrative
    	    entity.  For example Carleton county ceased to exist when it was
    	    subsumed into the City of Ottawa.
    	<li>A <span class='button'>Delete</span> button to delete the county.
    	<li>A  <span class='button'>Townships</span>button to open the 
    	    <a href='TownshipsEditHelpen.html'>
    	    dialog for editing the list of lower level administrative units</a> 
    	    within the county, such as towns and townships.
      </ul>
      <p>At the bottom of the page there are two buttons:
      <ul>
    	<li>The <span class='button'>Update Database</span> button applies 
    	    the changes you have entered on this page into the database.
    	    Note that pressing the Enter key while editing any input field
    	    also performs this function.  
    	<li>The <span class='button'>Add New County</span> button
    	    adds a new row at the bottom of the table, permitting you to
    	    add a county. 
        </ul>
      <p>Observe that the only way to change the three-character code identifying
    	a county is to add a new county and then delete the old county.
