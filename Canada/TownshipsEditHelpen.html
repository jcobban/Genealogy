    <h1>Edit Townships: Help
    </h1>
    <p>This page presents a list of all of the towns, villages, and townships 
    in a county which had a clerk for registering vital statistics.  This
    page permits adding, deleting, and modifying the descriptions of individual
    towns, villages, and townships.
    For each town, village, or township there is a row in the table containing:
    <ul>
	<li>A unique string which is used to identify the town, village, or
	    township within vital statistics records.  This is almost always
	    the same as the display name for the location, but needs to be
	    slightly different to deal with situations where two different
	    municipalities within a county have the same name.  For example
	    many towns have the same name as the township that they are
	    physically located within.
	<li>The full display name of the municipality.
	<li>A <span class='button'>Delete</span> button to delete the
	    municipality.
	<li>A  <span class='button'>Concessions</span>button to open the
	    <a href='ConcessionsEditHelpen.html'>
		dialog for editing the list of concessions</a> 
	    into which the township is divided for the purpose of describing
	    property locations.
    </ul>
    <p>At the bottom of the page there are two buttons:
    <ul>
	<li>The <span class='button'>Update Database</span> button applies 
	    the changes you have entered on this page into the database.
	    Note that pressing the Enter key while editing any input field
	    also performs this function.  
	<li>The <span class='button'>Add New Township</span> button
	    adds a new row at the bottom of the table, permitting you to
	    add a new town, village, or township to the list of administrative
	    municipalities in the county.. 
    </ul>
