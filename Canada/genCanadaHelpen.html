    <h1>Canadian Genealogy: Help</h1>
    <p>This website provides a broad range of genealogy related services,
    generally focussing on, but not limited to, south-western Ontario.
    </p>
    <p>This site focuses in particular on Canada, so there
    are a number of special services for collecting, distributing, and
    managing genealogical information for Canada.  These comprise:
    <ol>
        <li>Transcriptions of parts of the 
    	<a href="/database/genCensusesHelpen.html">censuses of Canada from 1851 to 1911</a>.
    	These transcriptions cover more columns of the originals than are
    	available from other sites, and can be searched using a lot of ways 
    	that are not supported.  For example you could search for all Butchers
    	in an area, or for Chinese individuals, or for members of the 
    	Swedenborgian church.  Although the completed portions of the
    	transcriptions are largely limited to south-western Ontario, the
    	service itself supports the entire country, and again can be
    	contributed to by many people through a web interface.
        <li>Transcriptions of thousands of 
    	<a href="/Ontario/genOntarioHelpen.html">birth, marriage, and death registrations</a>
    	for the province of Ontario.  Although Ancestry provides a much more
    	complete transcription, access to their service is by subscription,
    	and the service on this site provides more search options.
    	The transcription service supports contribution from volunteers
    	through a web interface.
