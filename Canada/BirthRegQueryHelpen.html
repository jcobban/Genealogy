		alt='Birth Registration Query'>
</p>
<p>The title includes the name of the province or state whose birth
registrations are to be searched.  This cannot be altered through this
dialog.  It is determined by the page from which you came to get to this
dialog.
</p>
<p><span class='label'>Identification:</span>
Permits searching for birth registrations by specifying the year of 
registration and the number assigned by the provincial or state Registrar 
when the records were indexed and microfilmed in the 1950s. 
Specifying the registration year
and number limits responses to the records with registration number between the
specified value, and that number plus the value of Count minus one. 
</p>
<p><span class='label'>Limit:</span>
Permits specifying the maximum number of matching entries to display at a time.
The default is 20 at a time. 
</p>
<p><span class='label'>Registration: County:</span>
If specified limits the response to births registered in the specified county.
</p>
<p><span class='label'>
Registration: Township:
</span>
If specified limits the response to births registered in the specified city,
town, or township.  For some counties this item is presented as a selection
list.
</p>
<p><span class='label'>Name: Given:</span>
If specified limits the response to births of individuals whose given name
matches the specified pattern.
The value is a regular expression.  In particular if a simple string is
given it matches all names that contain the string.  For example 'fred'
matches 'frederick', 'freddie', and 'alfred', among other names.
</p>
<p><span class='label'>Name: Family:</span>
If specified limits the response to births of individuals whose family name
matches the specified pattern. The type of search depends upon the value specified
here and if the Soundex option is selected. In particular if the value is composed
of letters of the alphabet and spaces then only names that match exactly will be
included, except if the Soundex option is specified.
However if the value contains characters that have a special meaning
in regular expressions
then a pattern match it performed.   For example 'smith$'
matches names that end in 'smith'.
</p>
<p><span class='label'>Soundex:</span>
If this option is checked then the Soundex algorithm is used to make the 
surname search based on sound rather than an exact match.

If specified limits the response to births of individuals whose sex matches the
specified value.
</p>
<p><span class='label'>Birth Date:</span>

specifying '1882' will match all dates in 1882.
</p>
<p><span class='label'>Birth Place:</span>
If specified limits the response to births of individuals whose birth place 
matches the specified pattern.
The value is a regular expression.  In particular if a simple string is
given it matches all birth places that contain the string.  For example 
'm.*x' matches places whose name contains the letter 'm' or 'M' and where somewhere
later in the place name there is a letter 'x' or 'X', for example 'middlesex', 'msx', and 'mexico', among others.
