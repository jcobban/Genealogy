      <h1>Supported Languages Table: Help</h1>
      <p>The Language Table is used to manage information about all of the
      languages which the site recognizes.  The presence of a language
      in this table does not mean that the site supports that language, that
      depends upon the implementation of specific support for each
      function in the site. If a particular function does not support your
      language a message to that effect is displayed along with the English
      version of the function.
      </p>
      <p>For each recognized language this application displays the recorded
      information associated with each ISO 639-1 two character identification
      code.  The information recorded for each language includes the
      name of the language in English, the native name of the language
      expressed in the script of the language, the definite article if any
      used before the name of the language, the possessive form used with the
      name of the language, and the text to be displayed to a user who
      requested the language if the specific function is not available
      in the requested language.
      </p>
      <p>You can scroll through the recognized languages by clicking
      on the forward and backward arrows that appear just under the title
      of the page.  You can also use the PageUp and PageDown keys on your
      keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>You can enter a portion of the language name in the pattern field.
      For example entering "en" and pressing the Enter key will display all
      languages whose English name contains the string "en".  If you want
      to look for names starting with a particular string prefix it by
      a caret "^".  For example "^f" will list all languages whose English
      name begins with the letter "F". If you want to look for names ending
      with a particular string add the suffix "$".  For example "sh$" will
      display languages ending with "sh" and "an$" will display languages
      ending in "an".
      </p>
