      <h1>Edit Concessions: Help
      </h1>
      <p>This page presents a list of all of the concessions into which
        a township is divided for the purpose of describing the location of
        properties.  Across most of North America rural areas were assigned in 
        terms of "sections" or "lots" each of 800 acres, identified by a concession
        and a lot number running from one end of the concession to the other.
        This
        page permits adding, deleting, and modifying the descriptions of individual
        concessions.
        For each concession there is a row in the table containing:
      <ul>
    	<li>A unique string which is used to identify the concession.  Most
    	    commonly concessions were simply numbered and such concessions
    	    are identified in this table by the string "con " plus the number.
    	    However other frequent concession names are:
    	    Broken Front, represented by the string "BF", which is used where
    	    one boundary of the township was a river or lakeshore;
    	    North or East or South or West Boundary, represented as "NB", "EB",
    	    "SB", or "WB".
    	    numbered ranges on either side of a baseline road, for example
    	    "1RN" or "3RS" or "SNBTR", etc.
    	<li>The latitude of the centre of lot 1 of the concession.
    	<li>The longitude of the centre of lot 1 of the concession.
    	<li>The increment (or decrement if negative) of latitude when the
    	    lot number increases by 1.
    	<li>The increment (or decrement if negative) of longitude when the
    	    lot number increases by 1.
    	<li>A <span class='button'>Delete</span> button to delete the
    	    concession.
    	<li>An <span class='button'>Add</span> button to insert a concession
    	    or concessions before or after a specific concession.
      </ul>
      <p>Note that the order of concessions is significant if the concessions
    	are parallel to each other, which is the most common situation, as
    	some of the tools for assisting the administer to initialize the
    	latitude and longitude of lot 1 of the concessions assume that
    	the concessions are in order.
      <p>At the bottom of the page there is a button:
      <ul>
    	<li>The <span class='button'>Update Database</span> button applies 
    	    the changes you have entered on this page into the database.
    	    Note that pressing the Enter key while editing any input field
    	    also performs this function.
