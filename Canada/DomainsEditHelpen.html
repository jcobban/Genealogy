    <h1>Edit Domains: Help
    </h1>
    <p>This page presents a list of all of the top-level administrative
    domains within a country.  These are usually called states or provinces.
    It permits adding, deleting, and modifying the descriptions of these
    administrative domains.
    </p>
    <p>There is a selection list which permits you to switch directly to
    another country without going back to the 
    <a href='CountriesEditHelpen.html'>List of Countries</a>.
    </p>
    <p>There is a selection list to choose between languages for the
    names of the domains.
    </p>
    <p><img src="/Images/EditDomains.png"></p>
    <p>
    For each domain there is a row in the table containing:
    <ul>
	<li>A four- or five-character mnemonic code used by other tables to
	    identify a domain.  This field is read-only except on a line
	    for adding a new domain.
	<li>The full name of the domain in the selected language.
	<li>If you are signed on as an administrator a 
	    <span class='button'>Delete</span> button to delete the domain.
	    Although the row is immediately removed from the display you
	    must click on the <span class='button'>Update Database</button>
	    to actually delete the record from the database.
	<li>A  <span class='button'>Counties</span>button to open the 
	    <a href='CountiesEditHelpen.html'>
	    dialog for editing the list of lower level administrative units</a> 
	    within the domain, such as cities and counties.
	<li>A link, made to look like a button, which opens the 
		<a href='genProvinceHelpen.html'>page for accessing
		the genealogical resources</a> specific to the domain.
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are signed on as an administrator
    	at the bottom of the page there are two buttons:
    <ul>
	<li>The <span class='button'>Update Database</span> button applies 
	    the changes you have entered on this page into the database.
	    Note that pressing the Enter key while editing any input field
	    also performs this function.  
	<li>The <span class='button'>Add New Domain</span> button
	    adds a new row at the bottom of the table, permitting you to
	    add a county. 
    </ul>
    <p>Observe that the only way to change the code identifying
	a domain is to add a new domain and then delete the old domain.
