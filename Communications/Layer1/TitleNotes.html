<h1>Physical Layer</h1>
<p>
In the layered data communications model the function of the physical layer 
is to transport streams of bits as accurately as possible between stations.  
At this layer errors are unavoidable because this is where "the rubber meets 
the road".  This layer is subject to all of the vagueries of the real world.  
That includes:
<ul>
	<li>Electrical interference
	<li>Characteristics of the media
	<li>Weather
	<li>Loose fitting connectors
</ul>
