<P>There are several characteristics which determine the suitability
of a physical layer implementation to a particular application.</P>
<H2>Delay</H2>
<P>Delay is the time it takes for each bit of information to reach
the other end of the medium. For example if you send the information
by surface mail the delay is typically two to three days within North
America. If you send the information by courier the delay is several
hours. If you use sound to transmit the message, as has been done by
the yodelers of Switzerland or the whistling shepherds of the Canary
Islands, the delay is about 3 seconds per kilometer. If you use
electromagnetic radiation, including signals in an electrically
conductive wire, radio waves, or optical signals, then the delay is 3
to 5 microseconds per kilometer, plus delays through electronic
components along the route.</P>
<P>The delay increases with distance. For example the delay in a
copper wire stretching 5,000 km is about 25 milliseconds. The delay
in a radio signal sent between two ground stations via a satellite in
geo-synchronous orbit is about <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&frac14;</FONT>
second.</P>
<H2>Bandwidth</H2>
<P>Bandwidth, expressed in Hz (sec<SUP>-1</SUP>), is the range of
frequencies which the transmission channel can carry. This
restriction may be a consequence of the physical nature of the media,
or may be imposed technically to prevent the information in one
channel from interfering with another channel, or may be as a result
of regulations dividing up the total available bandwidth. For example
a telephone circuit is designed to carry a 3kHz range of frequencies.
An FM radio station, to provide higher quality stereophonic audio,
has a bandwidth of 200kHz. A NTSC television channel has a bandwidth of
about 3MHz to be able to represent an analog video image changing 30 times a
second, as well as an analog FM audio channel. The bandwidth of a copper
wire or fibre-optic cable is limited by distortion, which increases
with distance, and, for copper, to prevent the generation of electromagnetic
interference.</P>
<H2>Signal/Noise Ratio</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>The signal to noise ratio, usually expressed in
decibels, is a measure of the quality of the channel.  <B>Signal</B>
is a transmission that carries the desired information.  <B>Noise</B>
is any transmission that is either meaningless or carries undesired
information.  Noise is introduced in transmitters and receivers
primarily as a result of the motion of molecules in the equipment due
to temperature.  In highly sensitive equipment, for example as used
in radio astrononomy, the receivers are chilled to within a few
degrees of absolute zero to minimize this.  In transmission through
space, including terrestrial microwave transmission, noise also comes
from the environment. </FONT> All information signals are carried
through a noisy environment.  In 1948 <A HREF="http://www.nyu.edu/pages/linguistics/courses/v610003/shan.html" target="footnote"><B>Claude
Shannon</B></A> developed the fundamental theorem of information
theory that the maximum capacity of of a channel depends upon the
bandwidth and the signal to noise ratio.  Increasing the capacity
requires either increasing the signal strength or bandwidth, which in
many cases is prohibited, or reducing the strength of the noise.  For
example noise can be reduced in a copper wire by shielding it from
external signals, for example in a coaxial cable.  One of the big
advantages of fiber optical transmission is that it is so easy to
reduce noise.</P>
<H2>Error Rate</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Error Rate is expressed as the fraction of bits which
are typically modified by the transmission channel.  </FONT><A HREF="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/paper.html" target="footnote">Shannon's
Law</A> shows that as you try to increase capacity beyond the maximum
capacity permitted by the signal/noise ratio, the error rate
increases so that the amount of information getting through goes
down.  Modern terrestrial transmission systems have typical error
rates of 1 bit error in a hundred million or a billion (10<SPAN STYLE="background: transparent"><SUP>-8</SUP></SPAN>
or 10<SUP>-9</SUP>).</P>
<H2>Capacity</H2>
<P>The capacity of a channel is the number of information bits it can
carry in a second, expressed in Hz (sec<SUP>-1</SUP>or b/sec).  For
example a dial-up modem may support 56Kb/sec<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>,
an ADSL high speed &ldquo;modem&rdquo; may support 1Mb/sec, and an
Ethernet Local Area Network may support 100Mb/sec.</P>
<P>Note that occasionally the capacity may be expressed in terms of
<B>Baud</B>.  Baud, from the early French telegrapher
<A HREF="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9013803" target="footnote">Jean-Maurice-Emile
Baudot</A> (1845-1903), properly represents the number of signal
transitions per second.  Since there may either be multiple signal
transitions per bit transmitted, or alternatively multiple bits
carried per signal transition, this terminology is misleading and has
gone out of fashion.</P>

	that all telephone systems carry &ldquo;voice&rdquo; circuits over a
	digital multiplexed network.  In telephone networks based upon North
	American standards the backbone carries a voice channel using a
	56Kb/s data channel and an 8Kb/s control channel.  In telephone
	networks based upon European standards the voice channel uses 64Kb/s
	and shares a 64Kb/s control channel with 29 other voice channels.</P>
