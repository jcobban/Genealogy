<h1>Descendant Tree: Help</h1>
<p>This page provides an outline summary of the descendants of the selected
individual.
It is typically displayed in a frame next to the display of information about
and individual.
</p>
<p>There is a text input field that permits you to specify how many generations
of descendants to display.  Just type a new number and press enter to change
the report.  The last number you entered is remembered for the next time
you view a descendant tree.
<p>There is a checkbox to specify whether or not you wish to see the location
information associated with the birth, death, and marriage events in this tree.
You toggle between the options by clicking in the checkbox.  The chosen option
is remembered for the next time you view a descendant tree.
<p>There is a <span class="button"><u>C</u>lose</span> button.  If the report
is displayed in its own window this button closes the window.  If the report
is displayed in its normal position in a frame next to the display of
information about an individual, the frame is cleared.
<p>There is a <span class="button"><u>F</u>ull Screen</span> button. 
If the report
is displayed in its normal position in a frame next to the display of
information about an individual, a new window (or tab depending upon your
browser configuration) is opened containing just this report.
<p>Each individual is indented to show the level of descent from the main
individual, and numbered to show their position among the children of a
particular family.  The name, birth date, and death date are collectively
made a hyper-link to the main web page for the particular individual, and the
hyperlink is color-coded to represent the gender of the individual, red for
women and blue for men (or dark red and dark blue if you have previously
visited the web page for the individual).
If this report
is displayed in its normal position in a frame next to the display of
information about an individual, then selecting the link will open the
information about the selected individual in the half-window, replacing the
descendant report.  However you can control where the page is displayed
by using the right button on your mouse.
