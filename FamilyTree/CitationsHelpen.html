	  <h1>Manage Master List of Citations: Help</h1>
	  <p>This page is used to search for and manage citations independently from
	    the individuals or facts that they document.
	  </p>
      <p>At the top the page reports the number of citations that matched
      the current request, or identifies missing information from the
      last request made.
      </p>
	  <p>The "Event Type" selection list is used to limit the response to
	    citations to a particular type of event or fact.  Most citations are to
	    generic events associated either with an individual ("Event")
	    or a family ("Marriage"),
	    however the site inherits information in which facts or events are recorded in
	    a non-standard way.  For example the birth of an individual may be recorded
	    either as a birth instance of a generic event, or as the birth attribute of an
	    individual.
      </p>
	  <p>The "Master Source" selection list limits the response to
	    citations to a specific document.  You must select a master source.
	  </p>
	  <p>The "Pattern" input field is used to search all of the citations matching
	    the "Event Type" and "Master Source" for those citations whose "page" field
	    matches a pattern.  The pattern is specified as a
	  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression'>Regular Expression</a>.
	    For example entering "<code>page</code>" matches all citations whose page field
	  <em>contains</em> the string "page".
	    Specifying "<code>^dist</code>" matches all citations whose page field
	  <em>starts</em> with the string "dist".
	    Specifying "<code>\d$</code>" matches all citations whose page field
	  <em>ends</em> with a decimal digit.
	    This search is insensitive to the case of letters.
	  </p>
      <p>The matching citations are listed in a table with two columns.
      If there are more matches than can be displayed at once this is preceded
      by a line which describes what portion of the matches is displayed
      and provided links for moving backward and forward through the
      result set.  You can also use the PgUp and PgDn keys to move through
      the set.
