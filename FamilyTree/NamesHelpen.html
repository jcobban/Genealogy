  <h1>Index of Individuals: Help</h1>
  <p>Selecting a surname
    displays a list of all of the individuals with that surname, as long as
    there are less than the value of the limit parameter, for which the
    default value is 100. If there are more than limit individuals with
    that surname then limit are shown and left and right arrows are
    displayed to permit you to scroll through the complete set.
  </p>
  <img src="SurnameFerris.png" alt="list of surname Ferris">
  <p>There is also a link to a summary of all of the surnames that match
    the same SOUNDEX code.
  </p>
  <p>In addition authorized contributors can manipulate
    additional information kept a surname by clicking on the
    <span class="button">Edit Surname Record</span> button.
  </p> 
  <img src="/Images/EditSurnameDialog.png" alt="edit Dialog for Surname">
  <p>The fields IDNR and Surname cannot be modified because they are the
    identifying keys of the record.  The SOUNDEX code is derived from the
    surname and represents a way to perform a search which is less sensitive
    to spelling mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>The Regular Expression Pattern is used in situations where too many
    surnames match the SOUNDEX code.  It permits defining a more detailed
    pattern match.  When you modify this field and then tab out a dialog
    pops up to summarize what will happen with this particular expression.
    This dialog may report a violation of the supported Regular Expression
    syntax, or it will display a list of all of the surnames which match
    the supplied pattern.
  </p>
  <p>The Notes field is a place to store information about the surname.
    This can be anything.  The field supports rich text, like a word processor
    and you can store many pages of descriptive information, including links
    to other web-sites.  You can copy information from other documents,
    including word processor documents. You can copy information from other
    web sites but it is plagiarism if you copy information without also
    including a link back to where you got the information.
