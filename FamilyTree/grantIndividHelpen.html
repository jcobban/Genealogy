<h1>Grant Access to Individual: Help</h1>
<p>This page documents the dialog that is displayed when you
click on the "Grant Access" button at the bottom of
the Edit Individual page.
</p>
<p>You are presented with a list of all of the other users registered on
the family tree.  Select one entry on this list and then click on the
"Grant Access" button.  That individual is then granted authority to update
the selected individual, all of that individual's ancestors, and all of that
individual's descendants currently in the family tree.  Note that if you
subsequently add ancestors or descendants the grant does not apply to them
proactively.  When you add an individual <b>you</b> are the only owner of
that individual until you grant access to someone else.
</p>
<p>The response displayed to you when you click on the "Grant Access"
button is a page listing all of the individuals for whom the access grant
applies.  The listing identifies the relationship between each person and
the base individual, the internal unique numeric key of the person in the
database, and the name of the person.  For reference purposes you might want
to print a copy of this report or save a copy as a file, so you can keep
track of to whom you have granted access to members of your family tree.
