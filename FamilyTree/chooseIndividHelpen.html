<h1>Choose Individual; Help</h1>
    <p>This page is used to choose an existing individual in the database to
	be used by the invoking script.  For example this page is used:
<ul>
  <li>To specify the individual whose family relationship to an other
      individual is to be determined.
  <li>To specify a child to add to a family.
  <li>To specify a spouse to add to a family.
</ul>
    <p>The page displays a selection list of 50 individuals
displayed in alphabetical order first by surname, and then by given name
within surname.
Initially this is the first 50 individuals in the database, starting with
those for whom no surname is known, or the first 50 individuals
starting with the individual whose name sorts as close to the
supplied name.  Subsequently the list updates on the fly as you
enter more information.
    </p>

    <p>When you type a surname, or the beginning
of a surname into the input field the list is updated on the fly whenever you
stop typing for more than a fraction of a second, to include the first 50
individuals whose surname, and optionally given name,
are sort at or immediately after the typed value.
    </p>
    <p>Since there are some family names for which there are more than 50 members,
you can also provide a given name, or prefix thereof, separated from the
surname by a comma and a space.  For example "Smith, John".
    </p>

    <p>Note how the names of the individuals are sorted first by surname,
then by given name within surname, and then by birth date,
and finally by death date.
    </p>
    <p>Select a specific individual in the list and then click on the
<span class='button'>Select</span> button to complete the action requested
by the invoking script.
