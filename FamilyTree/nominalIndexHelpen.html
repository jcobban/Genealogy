<h1>Index of Individuals; Help</h1>
<p>This page provides several ways of getting to the web page that displays
information about a particular individual from the database.  Multiple
techniques are provided for a number of reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The user may not know exactly how a particular name was spelled.
Having an alphabetically sorted list of all surnames assists to resolve this.
  <li>The user's browser may not support the technique used to obtain a list
of individuals on demand, so a more static method that does not depend upon
recent advances in browser technology is provided.
</ul>
<p>For most purposes the first technique provided will be effective and
convenient.  The selection list of individuals displays up to
50 individuals, with 10 visible at a time,
displayed in alphabetical order first by surname, and then by given name
within surname, and then by birth date.
Initially this is the first 50 individuals in the database, starting with
those for whom no surname is known.  Subsequently it updates on the fly as you
enter more information.  The last name you chose is remembered and
reapplied the next time you use this page.
</p>
<img src="InitialNameList.png" alt="Initial list of names">
<p>Observe how the individual names in the list are color-coded to identify
the sex of the individual: red for female, blue for male, and green for
individuals whose gender is not specified in the sources.  Each item 
contains the name, birth date, death date, and by default the names of 
the individuals parents and spouse[s].
</p>
<p>When you type a surname, or the beginning
of a surname into the input field the list is updated on the fly whenever you
stop typing for more than a fraction of a second, to include the first 50
individuals whose surname, and optionally given name,
are greater than or equal to the typed value.
</p>
<p>Since there are some family names for which there are more than 50 members,
you can also provide a given name, or prefix thereof, separated from the
surname by a comma and a space.  For example "Smith, John".
</p>
<img src="JohnSmithNameList.png" alt="list of names starting with John Smith">
<p>Note how the names of the individuals are sorted first by surname,
then by given name within surname, and then by birth date,
and finally by death date.
</p>
<p>Just below the field for entering the name is a pair of fields which permit
you to specify a range of birth years to limit the response.  By default this
range is set to include all possible birth years.
<p>Next comes a selection list permitting you to restrict the gender of
the names to match.  Initially there is no check for the sex of individuals
but you can restrict the response to just males or just females.
<p>The next option is a checkbox which permits you
to request that individuals whose married name matches the search name
also be included.  Observe that for these individuals both the married name
and the maiden name are displayed in the selection list.  With the
default option to include information on spouses you also get the name of
the husband.
</p>

<p>If you are a signed on as a registered contributor to the site a button
is provided which permit you to add a new individual to the family tree who is
not related to any other individual in the tree.
<p>Normally the display includes information about the parents and spouses of
each individual, so you can quickly identify which individual with a common
name is the individual you are looking for.  However you can choose to
hide either or both of these pieces of information using the checkboxes.
</p>
<p>When you use the mouse to click on one of the entries in the selection
list, the 
<a href="/FamilyTree/PersonHelpen.html">web page describing the individual</a> 
is displayed.  Note that only a single mouse click is required.
</p>
<p>As an alternate path to the individual web pages you may
select the first letter of the surname.  This displays a list of all of the
surnames in the database starting with that letter. 
</p>
<img src="SurnamesF.png" alt="list of surnames starting with F">
<p>Selecting a surname
displays a list of all of the individuals with that surname, as long as there
are less than 100. 
When you use the mouse to click on one of the "buttons" the 
<a href="/FamilyTree/PersonHelpen.html">web page describing the individual</a> 
is displayed.
</p>
<img src="SurnameFerris.png" alt="list of surname Ferris">
<p>If there are more than 100 you are given the option of
selecting one or more letters representing the beginning of given names to
select.  For example if you are looking for someone named Ellen or Helen you
may select both the letter 'E' and the letter 'H' by holding down the Ctrl
button while selecting the subsequent letters.
</p>
<img src="SurnameFisher.png" alt="list of surname Fisher">
<p>Select the "Search" button with the mouse, or press Enter, when
you have chosen all of the initial letters you wish.  You will then be
presented with a list of all matching individuals to choose from.
When you use the mouse to click on one of the "buttons" the 
<a href="/FamilyTree/PersonHelpen.html">web page describing the individual</a> 
is displayed.
