<h1>Locations Master list: Help</h1>
<p>Every location that is referenced by an event or fact in the database is
recorded in the Locations Master List.  This way all of the information
collected about a particular location is in a central location.  This,
in particular facilitates ensuring that particular locations are always
identified in the same way.
</p>
<p>You get to the Locations Master List from the Family Tree
<a href="/FamilyTree/ServicesHelpen.html">Top Level Services</a> web page.
When you first enter the Locations Master List web page it displays the first
20 locations in the list in alphabetical order.  You can scroll through the
list by clicking on the forward and backward arrows at the top of the list.
</p>
<p>You may use the "Pattern" field to search for locations based upon their
textual representation.  Technically the value you enter in this field
is a POSIX extended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
regular expression</a> pattern.
The following are just some of the ways you can use this pattern.
<ul>
  <li>Ordinary text, particularly text containing only letters, digits,
	and spaces, matches anywhere in the location.  For example
	entering "Michigan" will match all locations that contain the
	text "Michigan".  The match ignores the case, so this will also
	match "michigan" and "MICHIGAN".
  <li>The period '.' matches any single character.  You can use this
	any time you do not know, or care, about what character is present
	at a particular spot in the location.
  <li>The caret '^' (shift-6 on American keyboards) matches to the
	beginning of the location.  For example to find locations that
	start with "New" enter "^New", as just entering "New" matches 
	locations that contain the string "new" anywhere in the text.
  <li>The dollar sign '$' (shift-4 on American keyboards) matches to the
	end of the location.  For example to find locations that end with
	"USA" enter "USA$".
  <li>The asterisk '*' (shift-8 on American keyboards) causes the
	immediately preceding character to match zero or more repetitions.
	This is most commonly used with the period to skip over any number
	of characters that do not match.  For example the pattern "Mi.*USA"
	matches any location that has the text "Mi" and later on the text "USA"
	with any number of arbitrary characters in between.  For example it
	will match locations containing "MI, USA" and "Michigan, USA", as
	well as "Mississippi, USA".
  <li>There are many more options which you can experiment with.
</ul>
</p>
<p>The "Name" input field is primarily used to create new location names.
Normally a new location name is created automatically the first time the
location is referenced by the family tree.  However for administrative 
purposes it may be desirable to pre-define a location so that it will
have the preferred spelling, capitalization, abbreviation, and sort order,
rather than just accepting what the first reference suggests.
</p>
<p>Just type the complete location name into the "Name" field and press
enter, or click on the <span class="button">Search</span> button.  
If that name happens
to match an existing location name then the existing record is displayed in
a new tab or window.  Otherwise you are provided with the opportunity to
create a new location, signalled by an IDLR value of 0 in the
edit dialog.  The new location
is not actually added to the database until you click on the
<span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate&nbsp;Location</span> button.  If you
change your mind just close the window.
</p>
<p>Each of the locations displayed on this web page shows:
<ol>
    <li>The unique numeric key of the location.
	This numeric key is a link to a
	<a href="/FamilyTree/LocationHelpen.html">web page</a> 
	that displays the details recorded
	about the location, and if you are authorized to do so, permits you
	to edit those details.
    <li>The name of the location as it is displayed in reports.  This
	is frequently a complete postal address. 
    <li>An indicator of whether the description of the location includes its
	geographic coordinates, 
    <li>An indicator of whether the description of the location includes 
	any textual notes describing the location
    <li>An indicator of whether the description of the location includes
	a set of boundary coordinates (for extended areas such as states or
	counties).
</ol>
