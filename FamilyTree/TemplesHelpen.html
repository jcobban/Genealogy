<h1>LDS Temples Master list: Help</h1>
<p>Every temple that is referenced by an event or fact in the database is
recorded in the LDS Temples Master List.  This way all of the information
collected about a particular temple is in a central location.  This,
in particular facilitates ensuring that particular temples are always
identified in the same way.
</p>
<p>You get to the Temples Master List from the Family Tree
<a href="/FamilyTree/ServicesHelpen.html">Top Level Services</a> web page.
When you first enter the Temples Master List web page it displays the first
20 temples in the list in alphabetical order.  You can scroll through the
list by clicking on the forward and backward arrows at the top of the list.
</p>
<p>You use the "Pattern" field to search for temples based upon the
name of the temple.  Technically the value you enter in this field
is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
		regular expression</a> pattern.
The following are just some of the ways you can use this pattern.
<ul>
  <li>Ordinary text, particularly text containing only letters, digits,
		and spaces, matches anywhere in the temple.  For example
		entering "Michigan" will match all temples that contain the
		text "Michigan".  The match ignores the case, so this will also
		match "michigan" and "MICHIGAN".
  <li>The period '.' matches any single character.  You can use this
		any time you do not know, or care, about what character is present
		at a particular spot in the temple.
  <li>The caret '^' (shift-6 on American keyboards) matches to the
		beginning of the temple.  For example to find temples that
		start with "New" enter "^New", as just entering "New" matches 
		temples that contain the word "New" anywhere in the text.
  <li>The dollar sign '$' (shift-4 on American keyboards) matches to the
		end of the temple.  For example to find temples that end with
		"USA" enter "USA$".
  <li>The asterisk '*' (shift-8 on American keyboards) causes the
		immediately preceding character to match zero or more repetitions.
		This is most commonly used with the period to skip over any number
		of characters that do not match.  For example the pattern "Mi.*USA"
		matches any temple that has the text "Mi" and later on the text "USA"
		with any number of arbitrary characters in between.  For example it
		will match temples containing "MI, USA" and "Michigan, USA", as
		well as "Mississippi, USA".
  <li>There are many more options which you can experiment with.
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each of the temples displayed on this web page shows the unique numeric
key of the temple, the unique textual code for the temple,
and the temple name as it is displayed in reports. 
the numeric key is a link to a
<a href="/FamilyTree/TempleHelpen.html">web page</a> 
that displays the details recorded
about the temple, and if you are authorized to do so, permits you to edit
those details.
