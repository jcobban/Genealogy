      <h1>Sources Master list: Help</h1>
      <p>Every source that is referenced by a citation in the family tree is
      recorded in the Sources Master List.  This way all of the information
      collected about a particular source is in a central record.  This,
      in particular facilitates ensuring that particular sources are always
      identified in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>You get to the Sources Master List from the Family Tree
        <a href="/FamilyTree/ServicesHelpen.html">Top Level Services</a>
        web page.
        When you first enter the Sources Master List web page it displays
        the first 20 sources in the list in alphabetical order. 
        You can scroll through the
        complete list by clicking on the forward and backward arrows
        at the top of the list, or by using the PgUp and PgDn keys on
        the keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>You use the "Pattern" field to search for sources based upon their
        textual representation.  The value you enter in this field
        is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
        regular expression</a> pattern.
        The following are just some of the features of this pattern.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ordinary text, particularly text containing only letters, digits,
        	and spaces, matches anywhere in the source.  For example
        	entering "Michigan" will match all sources that contain the
        	text "Michigan".  The match ignores the case, so this will also
        	match "michigan" and "MICHIGAN".
        <li>The period '.' matches any single character.  You can use this
        	any time you do not know, or care, about what character is present
        	at a particular spot in the source.
        <li>The caret '^' (shift-6 on American keyboards) matches to the
        	beginning of the source.  For example to find sources that
        	start with "New" enter "^New", as just entering "New" matches 
        	sources that contain the word "New" anywhere in the text.
        <li>The dollar sign '$' (shift-4 on American keyboards) matches to the
        	end of the source.  For example to find sources that end with
      	    "USA" enter "USA$".
        <li>The asterisk '*' (shift-8 on American keyboards) causes the
        	immediately preceding character to match zero or more repetitions.
        	This is most commonly used with the period to skip over any number
        	of characters that do not match.  For example the pattern "Mi.*USA"
        	matches any source that has the text "Mi" and later on the text
            "USA" with any number of characters in between.  For example it
        	will match sources including "MI, USA", "Michigan, USA",
        	"Mississippi, USA", and "Miami, Florida, USA".
        <li>There are many more options which you can experiment with.
      </ul>
      <p>Each of the sources displayed on this web page shows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a button displaying the unique numeric key of the source,
            is a link to a
            <a href="/FamilyTree/SourceHelpen.html">subordinate form</a> 
            that displays the information recorded
            about the source, and if you are authorized to do so, permits you
            to edit those details.
        <li>the type or category to which this source belongs,
        <li>the source name as it is displayed in reports, 
        <li>the number of citations that reference this source. 
      </ul>
      <p>For example:
       <img src="SourceEntry.png" alt="Source Entry in List">
      </p>
      <p>If you are signed on as a registered user the main menu, 
        displayed when you click on the menu button at the
        top left of the page, includes an option to open a
        <a href="/FamilyTree/SourceHelpen.html">subordinate form</a> 
        to create a new source.
