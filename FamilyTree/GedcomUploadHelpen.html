<h1>Upload GEDCOM File: Help</h1>
<p>The Genealogical Data Communications (GEDCOM) file structure is used to
represent family tree information in textual format that can be exchanged 
between independently implemented family tree management software.  The
GEDCOM file structure was developed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints to permit their members to transmit organized genealogical information
to the central Ancestry File database.  The most popular, and most widely
implemented version of this file format is version 5.5.
</p>
<p>The information on this web-site started out as a Family Tree Maker for
Windows (FTW) database.  The database eventually outgrew the capacity and 
capabilities of FTW and it was migrated to Legacy Family Tree.  Legacy has the
ability to import many different representations of genealogical data, and in
this case it imported a GEDCOM 5.5 file that had been exported from FTW.
</p>
<p>Legacy, like many sophisticated Windows™ applications, uses a Microsoft®
Access database to store its information.  This is a partial implementation of
a Structured Query Language (SQL) relational database.  The most important
limitation of a Microsoft®
Access database is that it only supports access by a single user at a time.
This database was exported directly to the web server as a table by table, 
field by field translation to the MySQL server implementation which supports
multiple users and high performance.
</p>
<p>The original implementation of this web-site had not support for 
importing GEDCOM files because this seemed unnecessary since the database
content was a direct copy of the Legacy database, and therefore the
sophisticated import capabilities of Legacy could be used to make such
mass modifications.  However using that mechanism would require freezing
the web-site while it was copied back to a PC and updated by Legacy.  The
web-site would then have to go off-line temporarily while the database
was reloaded.
</p>
<p>Therefore a limited capability to import GEDCOM files directly into the
web-site has been implemented.
</p>
<p>Identify the GEDCOM file to be uploaded by clicking on the "Browse" button
and then click on the Upload button to start the process.
