  <h1>Edit Parents Help</h1>
<p>
The Edit Parents dialog is displayed when you click on the 'Edit' button
associated with Parents on the 
<a href="/FamilyTree/editIndividHelpen.html">edit individual</a> page.  This appears as
either <span class="button">Edit <u>P</u>arents</span> if there are
already defined parents for this individual, or as
<span class="button">Add <u>P</u>arents</span> if there are no parents
defined yet.
The Edit Parents dialog displays a list of the marriages or relationships
in which the identified individual is a child.
</p>
<p>For each marriage or relationship the dialog displays:
<ul>
  <li>The date, if known, of marriage.  This can be used to order the
	sets of parents chronologically.
  <li>The name of the father.
	This is a hyperlink to the web page of that individual.
  <li>The name of the mother.
	This is a hyperlink to the web page of that individual.
  <li>A checkbox indicating which of the sets of parents is preferred, and
	providing an interface for changing this preference.  Clicking on
	a preference box that does not have a check in it sets the
	selected parents as preferred, and clears the check mark from
	the former preferred parents.  Note that the preference is
	recorded in the individual's record, so it is not written to the
	database until you click on the 'Update Individual button of the
	invoking <a href="/FamilyTree/editIndividHelpen.html">edit individual</a> page.
  <li>A button to display the <a href="#marriage">edit dialog</a>

<h3>Events</h3>
<p>This section contains a summary of events associated with this family. 
This summary includes only the type of event, the date, and the place
of the event.  You can modify either date and place on this form.  More detailed
information about the wedding, including source citations and extended
textual description can be edited by clicking on the
<span class="button">Details</span> button at the end of this line.
<p>There are a number of events that can be recorded about a marriage,
for example the Church of Latter Day Saints sealing, formal engagement,
divorce, annulment, and whether or not the couple actually got married.  These
optional facts are summarized in optional lines following the wedding line.
To see more information about a specific fact, or to add source citations, or 
modify any details about a fact, click on the
<span class="button">Details</span> button in the specific line.
To remove any fact or event completely click on the
<span class="button">Delete</span> button in the specific line.
<p>Following the last event is a line containing an
<span class="button">Add Event</span> button.  Clicking on this button
opens a <a href="/FamilyTree/editEventHelpen.html">dialog</a> to define a new event.
This line also includes an
<span class="button">Order Events by <u>D</u>ate</span> button.
<h3>General Information</h3>
    <p>The first line of this section displays the internal record number of
	the marriage in a read-only field.  This is used for debugging.
    </p>
    <p>The next line of the dialog contains a selection list which permits you
	to specify what the current or ending status of the relationship is.
    </p>
    <p>The next line of the dialog contains a selection list which permits you
	to specify how the married surnames of the partners are assigned.  The
	default is the traditional western rule that the male partner retains
	his birth surname while the female partner takes her
	male partner's surname. 
	This selection
	controls how the married surname fields higher up the dialog behave.
    </p>
    <p>The next portion of the dialog is a rich-text editor that permits you
	to enter general information about the relationship. 
	Do not record anything
	here that can be more precisely described using other features of this
	dialog.  In particular do not record any of the information that can be
	recorded as a marriage related event.  You could, for example, use this
	space to identify the witnesses to the marriage, and the name of
	the minister
	as obtained from the civil marriage registration.
	Because this is a rich-text editor those names could be inserted as
	links to the individual pages for those individuals.
	However if you wish to quote from the marriage notice in a newspaper
	that quote should be recorded in the source citation text.
    </p>
    <p>Below this text editor is a 
	<span class="button">Details</span> button that opens a dialog 
	to specify, in particular, source citations for the text.
    </p>
    <p>Clicking on <span class="button">Edit <u>P</u>ictures</span>
	opens a dialog that permits you to associate images with this
	family.
    </p>
<h3>Children</h3>
    <p>The last major portion of this dialog contains information on the
	children of this relationship.
<!--
    <p>The first line of this section contains a check-box that you can use
	to indicate that to your certain knowledge this relationship had no
	children.
	The <span class="button">Details</span> button at the end of this line
	permits you to identify the source of this knowledge.
-->
	<p>This features a table which displays for each child the
	name of the child, highlighted in blue for males, in red for females,
	and green for children for whom the sex is unknown, the
	date of birth, the date of death, an
	<span class="button">Edit Child</span> 
	button that can be used to open an
	<a href="/FamilyTree/editIndividHelpen.html">edit individual</a> dialog to modify any
	details about the child, and a <span class="button">Detach Child</span>
	button to detach (not delete) this child from this family.
    <p>You can use the Tab key to advance through the input fields for a child,
	and to set the focus to either of the buttons. 
	Shift-Tab moves backward through the fields. 
	Pressing the Enter key in any of the input fields moves
	the focus down to the given name field of the next child. 
	If you do this on
	the last child, an empty child is added to the table, just as if you
	had clicked on the <span class="button">Add <u>N</u>ew Child</span> 
	button.  The up and down arrow keys can be used to move within a column.
    <p>The last line of this section contains an 
	<span class="button">Add <u>E</u>xisting Child</span> button that
	opens a dialog to choose an existing individual in the database
	to add as a child of this family,
	and an <span class="button">Add <u>N</u>ew Child</span> 
	button that opens an
	<a href="/FamilyTree/editIndividHelpen.html">edit individual</a> dialog to create
	a new individual to be added as a child.
    <p>Clicking on 
	<span class="button"><u>O</u>rder Children by Birth Date</span>
	sorts the children by birth date.  To make use of this feature
	ensure that you have entered something for the birth date of
	each child so that even if you do not know the birth date, the
	children will sort correctly.
    <p>The bottom line of the dialog contains two buttons:
    <ul>
    <li>Clicking on <span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate Family</span>
	writes all of the changes you have made to the database
	and hides the dialog.
    <li>Clicking on <span class="button"><u>C</u>lose</p>
	closes the dialog without applying any changes to the database.
