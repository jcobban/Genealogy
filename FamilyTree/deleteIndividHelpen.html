<h1>Delete Individual: Help</h1>
<p>This page is used to report the results of a request to delete
an individual from the database.
</p>
<p>You request the deletion of an individual from the database
from the <a href="/FamilyTree/editIndividHelpen.html">Edit Individual Page</a>
where you click on the "Delete Individual" button.  Note that this
button is only displayed to you when the individual in question has
no family connections.  That is the individual is entirely unconnected
to the family tree.  This means that once you identify an individual
as a candidate for deletion, you must first detach the individual from
any spousal relationship, or relationship as a child of a family.
</p>
<p>If you cheat and try invoking the web page explicitly, by
modifying the URL in your browser to identify an individual by IDIR,
then error messages are displayed.  In particular an error
message is displayed if the individual
is not a valid candidate for deletion because of existing family
relationships.
</p>
<p>The completion of the request results in a report of how many
citation records, individual event records, and individual records (1)
were deleted as a result of your request.
</p>
<p>To proceed out of this page select one of the items in the header
section of the page.  The most likely destination is the nominal index.
