  <h1>Edit Source Record Help</h1>
<p>
The Edit Source Record dialog is displayed when you click on the 
<span class="button">Edit</span> button on a row of the
<a href="/FamilyTree/SourcesHelpen.html">Sources Master List</a> page or 
choose the option to "Add New Source" when adding a citation on the
<a href="/FamilyTree/editEventHelpen.html">edit event</a> dialog.  You will not
be presented with either option if you are not authorised to edit the
family tree database.</p>
<p>The Edit Source Record dialog presents a form permitting you to
alter any of the pieces of information that are recorded about a
Master Source.
</p>
<p>The dialog presents the following:
  <ul>
    <li>The name of the Source Record as an input field
    <li>The type of Source Record as a selection list.
    <li>The title of the Source Record as it is presented in the footnotes
  	section of the
	<a href="/FamilyTree/PersonHelp.php">individual display page</a>.
	This is typically the same as, and defaults to, the name of the
	record. 
    <li>The author of the source document as a text input field.
    <li>The publisher of the source document as a text input field.
    <li>Text about the source document as copied from the source itself
	as an extended text area.
    <li>Notes about the source document as an extended text area.
    <li>A selection list of existing repositories holding source
	documents from which to select a repository containing the
	source document, preferably a repository where the document can
	be publically consulted.
    <li>A text input field to be used if it is necessary to add a
	new repository.  Note that the only information that can be
	defined about a new repository in this form is the name of the
	repository.  It is necessary to go to the
	<a href="/FamilyTree/AddressesHelpen.html">Addresses Master List</a> 
	to define any additional
	information about the repository, such as its mailing address.
    <li>The call number of the document within the repository, 
	for example its LC number.
  </ul>
</p>
<p>At the bottom of the form there is an 
<span class="button">Update Source</span> button to
apply the changes to the master source record.
