<h1>Family Tree Services: Help</h1>
<p>This page lists the functions that apply to the family tree as a whole.
<ul>
  <li>Find an individual in the family tree 
	<a href="/FamilyTree/nominalIndexHelpen.html">by name</a>.
       	Most casual users
	of the family tree will go directly to this web page.
  <li>Add a <a href="/FamilyTree/addIndividHelpen.html">new individual</a>
	who is not related to any existing individual in the
	family tree.  If the new individual is related to an existing
	individual, then the individual should be added as a
	<a href="/FamilyTree/addChildHelpen.html">child</a> of an
	existing family, as a
	<a href="/FamilyTree/addSpouseHelpen.html">spouse</a> of an existing individual, or 
	as a
	<a href="/FamilyTree/addParentsHelpen.html">parent</a> of an existing individual.
	If there is no likelihood of the new individual being connected to
	anyone in the existing tree, you should consider creating a brand
	new tree.
  <li>Find, and if authorized update, 
	<a href="/FamilyTree/LocationsHelpen.html">locations</a> that are used in the
	family tree.  This table contains every location that is referenced
	by any event in the family tree.
  <li>Find, and if authorized update, 
	<a href="/FamilyTree/SourcesHelpen.html">master source records</a> that are
	referenced by citations in the family tree.  A master source is a
	resource, whether conventional or electronic, that contains
	documentary evidence supporting the facts recorded in the tree.
  <li>Find, and if authorized update, 
	<a href="/FamilyTree/AddressesHelpen.html">address records</a> that 
	contain detailed information about how to communicate with
	individuals or institutions connected to the family tree, or
	as a more detailed substitute for a location record.
  <li>View, and if authorized update, the list of
	<a href="/FamilyTree/EventTypesHelpen.html">event types</a>. 
	Each entry in this list describes a
	type of event or fact that can be recorded in the event table for
	an individual or family.
	Making this an editable table permits extending and customizing
	the information that is recorded in the database, and how it is
	presented to the users.
  <li>View, and if authorized update, the list of
	<a href="/FamilyTree/ChildStatusHelpen.html">child statuses</a>. 
	Each entry in this list describes a
	status that a child has at birth, such as being stillborn.
	Making this an editable table permits extending and customizing
	the information that is recorded in the database, and how it is
	presented to the users.
  <li>View, and if authorized update, the list of
	<a href="/FamilyTree/ChildRelationsHelpen.html">child to parent relationships</a>. 
	Each entry in this list describes a type of relationship
	that a child can have to a parent, such as being adopted.
	Making this an editable table permits extending and customizing
	the information that is recorded in the database, and how it is
	presented to the users.
