<h1>Family Tree Services: Help</h1>
<p>This page lists the functions that apply to the family tree as a whole.
  <ul>
    <li>Find an individual in the family tree 
	<a href="/FamilyTree/nominalIndexHelpen.html">by name</a>.
       	Most casual users
	of the family tree will go directly to this web page.
    <li>Add a <a href="/FamilyTree/addIndividHelpen.html">new individual</a>
	who is not related to any existing individual in the
	family tree.  If the new individual is related to an existing
	individual, then the individual should be added as a
	<a href="/FamilyTree/addChildHelpen.html">child</a> of an
	existing family, as a
	<a href="/FamilyTree/addSpouseHelpen.html">spouse</a>
	of an existing individual, or as a
	<a href="/FamilyTree/addParentsHelpen.html">parent</a>
	of an existing individual.
	If there is no likelihood of the new individual being connected to
	anyone in the existing tree, you should consider creating a brand
	new tree.
    <li>Show a list of
	<a href="/FamilyTree/showAddedIndividualsHelpen.html">
		individuals recently added to the family tree</a>.
    <li>Display
	<a href="/FamilyTree/StatusHelpen.html">
		high level statistics</a>
	of the database.
    <li>Request a 
	<a href="/FamilyTree/reqReportIndividsHelpen.html">
		report</a>
	of individuals in the family tree based upon many characteristics.
    <li>Display
	<a href="/FamilyTree/CitationsHelpen.html">
		source citations matching a pattern</a>.
    <li>Calculate an estimated birth date for an individual based upon
	<a href="/FamilyTree/calcBirthDateHelpen.html">
		age at the time of an event</a>.
    <li>Display a list of
	<a href="/Canada/CountriesEditHelpen.html">
		countries</a> that are recognized by the site.
    <li>Display a list of
	<a href="/Canada/LanguagesEditHelpen.html">
		languages</a> that are recognized by the site.
    <li>Find and update 
	<a href="/FamilyTree/LocationsHelpen.html">locations</a>
	that are used in the
	family tree.  This table contains every location that is referenced
	by any event in the family tree.
    <li>Search for
	<a href="/FamilyTree/TemplesHelpen.html">
		temples of the Church of Latter Day Saints
	</a>
	that are referenced by events in the family tree.
    <li>Find and update 
	<a href="/FamilyTree/SourcesHelpen.html">master source records</a>
	that are
	referenced by citations in the family tree.  A master source is a
	resource, whether conventional or electronic, that contains
	documentary evidence supporting the facts recorded in the tree.
    <li>Find and update 
	<a href="/FamilyTree/AddressesHelpen.html">address records</a> that 
	contain detailed information about how to communicate with
	individuals or institutions connected to the family tree, or
	as a more detailed substitute for a location record.
  </ul>
