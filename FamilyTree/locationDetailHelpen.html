<h1>Specifying Locations: Help</h1>
<p>If you wish to add a child to an existing set of parents, follow
<p>You should try to be as consistent as possible in how you identify the same
location in all events.  The overall rule is locations are specified
from most precise to least precise.   Locations are collected in a table
based upon a case-insensitive comparison.  For many locations an abbreviation
is defined that avoids the need to type the entire location name.  
The following are more detailed guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The country should appear at the end of all addresses, either as the
	full country name or the ISO 2-character country code.  For example:
	"Ontario, CA, US" for the city in California, 
	as opposed to "Ontario, CA" which 
	would be used for the province in Canada.
	On the other hand the database does not specify, for example,
	"England, UK" because England, and the other components of
	the United Kingdom, are generally thought of as countries.
	The country name at the time of the event should be used, for example
	"Prussia" or "Assyria".
    <li>For North American addresses the second last portion should be the
	name or 2-character postal abbreviation of the state, province,
	or territory.  The name at the time of the event should be used.
	Thus "Upper Canada" (1792 - 1851), or "Canada West" (1852 - 1867),
	not the anachronistic "Ontario" or "ON".  The abbreviations "UC", "LC",
	"CE", and "CW" can be used.
    <li>For North American rural addresses the full county name should be the
	third last portion.  For example "Lobo, Middlesex, ON, CA".  A
	rural address is any address that is not in a city.  If the location
	is the county itself, then the abbreviation "Co" should be either
	prefixed or suffixed to the county name as traditional.  For example:
	"Co Galway, Ireland" or "Middlesex Co, ON, CA".
    <li>For urban addresses the city name is the third last portion of the
	location.  For example "Detroit, Michigan, USA" or "Detroit, MI, US",
	not "Detroit, Wayne, MI, US".
    <li>Incorporated towns and townships are identified in the fourth last
	portion of the location, followed by the county, state, and country:
	"Strathroy, Middlesex, ON, CA".
    <li>Villages are normally identified in the fifth last portion of the
	location, followed by the township, county, state, and country.
	However villages frequently straddle township boundaries.  Where this
	is the case the original source may not identify which of the townships
	the location refers to.  In this case the township may be omitted
	and the village is treated as if it was an incorporated town.
    <li>For rural locations identified by lot and concession number, the 
	hierarchy from most to least precise is continued.  For example:
	"N Â½ lot 13 con 1, Ekfrid, Middlesex, ON, CA".  Note portion before lot
	before concession, even if the original source puts concession first.
