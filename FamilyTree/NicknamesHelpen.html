<h1>Given Names Table Edit: Help</h1>
  <p>This page is used for editing the table of alternate Given Names.
  </p>
  <p>Original documents frequently have unusual spellings for given names which,
    if taken literally, would not match to the appropriate individuals in the
    family tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example a document contains information about an individual where
    the given name was spelled "Arthereld".  To ensure that this will match an
    individual in the family tree named "Ethelred" the alternate given names 
    table defines a search prefix "Ethel" to use when searching with
    "Arthereld" so, in addition to searching for individuals whose
    given name startes with the prefix "Ar" the results of the
    search will also include individuals who has a given name
    starting with "Ethel".
  </p>
  <p>The alternate given names is used to define a prefix, or list of prefixes,
    which are used to match the beginning of each given name in the family 
    tree based upon a literal given name from an original document.  
    For information purposes it also has a field which displays the
    "normal" spelling of the given name or names which it appears
    the author of the original document intended. 
  </p>
  <p>
    All name searches include gender if the original document contained a
    gender.
    For example most vital statistics (birth, marriage, and death) contain a
    gender, as well as censuses.  However the Wesleyan Methodist baptisms for
    Ontario and Quebec do not, and the British vital statistic registry indices
    do not.
  </p>
  <p>
    When searching for a match on given name if the search value consists of
    multiple names then the search is done for each of the names and is compared
    to each of the parts of the given name of each individual in the
    family tree.
    For example if the search value, from the original document, is 
    "George William" then it will be match against anyone who has a given
    name matching either "George" or "William".
  </p>
  <p>
    When comparing a given name component to a given name component the
    comparison is usually done in a "loose" manner to tolerate normal
    variations.  The current procedure is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>if the given name matches an entry in the alternate names table
	then the search is done using the list of prefixes defined in the
	table. 
	The table can be used to reduce the number of matches for extremely
	common names, for example "Mary", by requiring a match on more then
	the default 2 characters.
	Otherwise ...
    <li>If the given name component is a single letter or a single letter
	followed by a period, that is an "initial", the single letter
	matches against any given name starting with that letter.
	For example "G." will match "George", "Grace", "Gordon", or "Gertrude".
	Otherwise ...
    <li>If the given name is at least 2 characters long it matches all
	given names starting with the first 2 characters.  For example "John"
	or "Joan" or "Jonathan" or "Joanna" will all match any given name
	starting with "Jo".
  </ul>

  <p>
    When entered with no parameters the dialog displays the first 20
    entries from the table, and you can scroll through the entire table
    using the left and right arrow hyperlinks.  When you hold the cursor
    over these hyperlinks the application displays an explanation of what
    clicking on the hyperlink will do.
    You can enter text into the "Pattern" field to limit the display to entries
    whose "nickname" field matches the pattern.  This is a regular expression.
    For example if you enter "th" only entries whose "nickname" field
    <em>contains</em> the string "th" are displayed. 
    If you enter "^g" then only entries whose "nickname" field
    <em>starts</em> with the letter "g" are displayed.
    If you enter "s$" then only entries whose "nickname" field
    <em>ends</em> with the letter "s" are displayed.
  </p>
  <p>The first column displays the value that matches exactly to a given name
    as found in a transcriptions of an original document.
  </p>
  <p>The second contains a given name prefix, or a comma-separated list of
    given name prefixes that will be used to search the family tree for
    a match.  The first entry will match against given names such as "Betrice",
    or "Beatrice", or "Trisha".
  </p>
  <p>The third column is a comment indicating the most popular "standard"
    spelling of the given name.
