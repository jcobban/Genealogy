  <h1>Individuals by Location: Help</h1>
    <p>This web page displays a list of each of the individuals
      and/or families that contain events that reference the current location
      along with a description of the nature of the event or fact.
      If you are authorized to modify the family tree these are links to
      the edit page for the associated record.  Otherwise they are links to
      the normal web page for the individual or family.  If there are no events
      that reference this location then a button is presented permitting you to
      delete the location from the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      This script supports the following parameters:
      <table>
	<thead>
	  <tr>
	    <th class="label center">Parameter</th>
	    <th class="label center">Interpretation</th>
	  </tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <th class="label">IDLR</th>
	    <td class="left">
	      The unique internal identification number of the Location record.
	    </th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <th class="label">Limit</th>
	    <td class="left">
	      To avoid generating an extremely large response the script limits
	      the number of instances of each of the three kinds of events
	      that it reports to a default of 25.  This parameter permits
	      overriding that default.
	    </th>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
      </table>
    </p>
    <h2>Procedure for Deleting Locations</h2>
    <p>If an administrator wishes to delete a location the administrator
      must first re-direct all existing references to another location.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Select one of the existing references to the location.  
	Selecting the reference displays either the
	<a href="/FamilyTree/editIndividHelpen.html">edit page for the individual</a> or
	<a href="/FamilyTree/editMarriageHelpen.html">edit page for the family</a>.
    <li>Locate the current reference in the individual or family.  The 
	location is contained in an event.
    <li>Edit the location text in the event to refer to another location.
    <li>When you have applied the update click on the browser 
	"Go back one page" icon one or more times
	to get back to the list of individuals and
	families referencing the location.  If there are no more references
	then a button is presented to delete the location.  Otherwise repeat
	the process for the next reference.
</ol>
<p>You get to this web page by clicking on the link on the 
<a href="/FamilyTree/LocationHelpen.html">Display/Edit Location</a> web page.
