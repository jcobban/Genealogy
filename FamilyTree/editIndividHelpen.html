<h1>Edit Person: Help</h1>
<p>This page is used to update information recorded about an
individual.
</p>
<p>Note that hovering the mouse for more than 2 seconds over an input
field or button, 
on any of the dialogs in this application pops up a text bubble that
explains the purpose of the field and describes
the values that may be entered into the field.
</p>
<img src="/Images/EditPersonTop.png" alt="Action buttons of Edit Person dialog">
<p>When you have completed making all of the desired changes to this 
form, apply the changes to the database by clicking on the 
<span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate&nbsp;Person</span>
button or using one of the keyboard short-cuts: ctrl-S or alt-U. 
Note that the initial letter 'U' in the button label is underlined to
remind you of the option to use alt-U as a keyboard short-cut.
</p>
<p>If the person has no family connections:  That is the person
is neither a spouse in a relationship, nor a child belonging to a
family, then a
<span class="button"><u>D</u>elete&nbsp;Person</span>
button is displayed giving you the option of deleting the person
from the database altogether.
You may either click on this button with
the mouse, or use the keyboard short-cut alt-D to perform this function.
Note that the initial letter 'D' in the button label is underlined to
remind you of the option to use alt-D as a keyboard short-cut.
There is no method for deleting a person that has a family connection:
You must remove all such connections before deleting a person.  However
you always have the option of merging a person with another existing
individual.
</p>
<p>A <span class="button"><u>M</u>erge</span>
button is presented at the top of the page to enable you to
merge the current individual with another individual in the database
that you have determined is a duplicate reference to the same individual.
Clicking on the <span class="button"><u>M</u>erge</span>
button with the mouse, or using the keyboard
short-cut alt-M invokes the 
<a href="/FamilyTree/mergeIndividHelpen.html">Merge Persons web page</a>.
Note that the initial letter 'M' in the button label is underlined to
remind you of the option to use alt-M as a keyboard short-cut.
</p>
<p>The <span class="button"><u>G</u>rant Access</span> button permits you
allow other members of your family to have access to the private information
about specific members of your family and to contribute to your family 
tree by adding new members and modifying information about them.
Clicking on this button displays the 
<a href="/FamilyTree/grantIndividHelpen.html">Grant Access web page</a>.
</p>
<p>The <span class="button"><u>S</u>earch</span> button is under
construction.  The only option that works at the moment is the 
vital statistics record search.
</p>
<h2>Identity</h2>
<img src="/Images/EditPersonIdentity.png" alt="Identity portion of Edit Person Dialog">
<p>The family tree database manager assigns the internal IDIR value
when a member of the family tree is added.  It is a
unique numeric key for this individual that is used to reference this
individual from other records in the database.  This is separate from the
preceding field to permit renumbering individuals. 
If the database is loaded from a GEDCOM file then the IDIR value
matches the numeric portion of the index of the INDI record.
This cannot be changed and will be hidden at some point because there
is nothing that most users can use it for.
</p>
<p>You may edit the surname of the person.
Note that changing the surname causes
a number of other fields and records to be updated.  In particular the
readonly Soundex value is updated in this dialog.
The surname field in all marriages of which this individual is a partner
is changed.  If the traditional western rule that the wife took her husband's
surname was followed then the married surname of all wives are changed.
And appropriate changes are made to the entries for this individual in the
"Alternate Names" table, 'tblNX'.
Also if the surname does not already appear in the database, a record is
added into the surname table, 'tblNR'.
</p>
<p>You may edit the given names of the person. 
The given names field in all marriages of which this individual is a partner
is changed, and the appropriate entries in the alternate names table
are updated.
</p>
<p>The <span class="button">Details</span>
button following the "Given Names" field 
pops up a <a href="/FamilyTree/editNameHelpen.html">dialog</a> that
provides the
ability to add further information about the name into the database.
In particular this includes textual notes, for example explaining where the
name came from, such as being named after an uncle or grandmother,
the name prefix and suffix if applicable, and any alternate names by which
the person was known.
The dialog also provides the ability to cite sources for knowledge of the
name.
</p>
<p>Aside from marriage the names of a person can change for other
reasons including personal choice.  If a person has alternate names
these are listed below the primary names with the option to view or modify
details.  There is also a <span class="button">Add&nbsp;Name</span> button
to permit defining an additional alternate name. 
This pops up a <a href="/FamilyTree/editNameHelpen.html">dialog</a> that
provides the ability to modify any of the information about an alternate
name.
<p>You must specify the gender of the person.  For the 100 most common
female given names in the 19th century the gender defaults to female.
</p>
<p>If this dialog is invoked from the list of children on a marriage,
either through clicking on the
<span class="button">Edit&nbsp;Child</span> button, or the
<span class="button">Add&nbsp;New&nbsp;Child</span>
button, then an additional section appears in this web page to permit
describing in more detail the role of the child in the family.
<p>The "Status" selection list is used to describe the child's status
as a result of the birth.
<p>For each of the parents there is a selection list to define the
relationship of the child to that parent, and a check box to specify whether
or not the information about that relationship is to be revealed to
casual viewers.  For example some families are uncomfortable about 
advertising adoptions.
<h2>Events</h2>
<img src="/Images/EditPersonEvents.png" alt="Events portion of Edit Person Dialog">
<p>All of the recorded events or facts for this individual are presented
in this dialog in a consistent way so they can be added, modified,
or deleted
using consistent actions.  An event is an action that took place at some
specific moment in time and at some specific location although the exact
date and place may not be known.  An event changes the status of the
individual.  Death is an example of an event that changes the status
of the person from living to dead.  A fact is an attribute of the
individual which persists for some period of time but may be observed at
some specific time and place.  For example the fact that the person was
working as a Carpenter in a particularly community may be observed at some
specific time, but was true both before and after the observation. 
Each row of the list of events and facts contains six elements.
<ol>
    <li>The type of event or fact, such as Birth, or Death, or Immigrated,
    	or "worked as a".
    <li>The date on which the event took place or the fact was observed.
    	Although an event takes place on a specific date the exact date
        may not be known. 
        For example a person may only be known to have died between
	    1881 and 1890.  On the other hand a fact persists through time
        so you may record that the person worked as a Miller
        from 1881 to 1891.
    	If known this is normally expressed as numeric day,
    	an abbreviation of the month name, and the year.  For example
    	"13 Aug 1894".
    <li>For most facts, but not typically for events, the description of the
    	fact, that is any information other than the location
    	is presented in an input field.
    	For example for the "Worked as a" event the description is the
    	name of the occupation, and possibly the name of the employer.
    <li>The location where the event took place or the fact was observed.
    	Each location in this
    	application is actually a reference to a record in the 
	    <a href="/FamilyTree/LocationsHelpen.html">location table</a>. 
    	The text you enter is used to find or create a record in
        this table.
	    <br>
    	When you finish typing in the location field,
        indicated by for example tabbing to the next field
        or using the mouse to click in another field,
    	the text you have typed is first processed to capitalize all words
    	except for a handful of prepositions and standard abbreviations
    	are expanded.  You can see the full list of supported abbreviations
    	by holding the mouse cursor over the field for 2 seconds.
	<br>
    	Then the resulting text is used to search the location table for a
    	match.  The search is done ignoring the case of letters.
    	The application looks first for a full match on the short name for
    	a location and if one is found the full name replaces
        the entered value.
    	If this search fails then a search is made for location names that
    	start with the supplied text.  If only one match is found then that
    	location replaces the typed value. 
        If more than one match is found then a selection list
    	appears under the input text field giving you the option of
        selecting
    	the best match.  Note that even after the application has filled
    	in the value you do not have to accept it as is.  For example say
    	you want to record that an event took place at a specific location
    	in Westminster township.  You can
    	type in "westminster".  When you leave the input field 
    	the full location name associated with that string replaces the 
    	portion you have entered, for example
    	"Westminster, Middlesex, ON, CA".  You may then go back into the
    	field and insert the specific location within the township
    	at the front.
	<br>
    	If no matches are found to the supplied text then you are warned
    	that if you proceed to update the database a new location record
    	will be created.
    <li>A checkbox indicating whether this instance is the preferred
    	instance for events of a particular class.  For example you can
    	designate one Birth event as the preferred instance.  Only this
    	instance is reported in situations where only one can be reported.
    <li>Clicking on the <span class="button">Details</span> button
    	opens a <a href="/FamilyTree/editEventHelpen.html">dialog</a>
        that permits you 
    	to alter all of the information recorded about a fact or event, not
    	just the identifying fields that are displayed on the main page.
    	In particular this includes source citations for the fact and
    	frequently extended comment text.
    <li>Clicking on the <span class="button">Delete</span> button
    	removes the associated event from the person.  For some types
    	of events this will result in the entire row disappearing from
    	the main page, however for some key events are simply blanked out
    	so you can reenter them without having to explicitly add an event.
    	The application prompts for you to confirm the intention to delete
    	the event.
</ol>
<p>The first row in the events display specifies the date and location
where the person was born.  This row is always present even if the
information is unknown.
</p>
<p>The second row specifies the date of and location where the
individual was christened.  This row is always present even if the
information is unknown.
Note that because of the key contributions
to genealogy by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS), the
term "christening" is specifically used to describe a baptism in a
trinitarian Christian church.  On the other hand
the term "baptism" is used exclusively for the LDS sacrament.
</p>
<p>If the person has been baptized by the LDS then that information
appears in the next row.  This row is present only if information about the
LDS baptism has been recorded.
The location information for a baptism, which is usually the name of the
temple, cannot be modified on this page.  Click on the
<span class="button">Details</span> button.
</p>
<p>If the person has been endowed by the LDS then that information
appears in the next row.  This row is present only if information about the
LDS endowment has been recorded.
The location information for an endowment, which is the name of the
temple, cannot be modified on this page.  Click on the
<span class="button">Details</span> button.
</p>
<p>If the person has been confirmed by the LDS then that information
appears in the next row.  This row is present only if information about the
LDS confirmation has been recorded.
The location information for a confirmation, which is usually the name of the
temple, cannot be modified on this page.  Click on the
<span class="button">Details</span> button.
</p>
<p>If the person has received initiatory by the LDS then that information
appears in the next row.  This row is present only if information about the
LDS initiatory has been recorded.
The location information for an initiatory, which is the name of the
temple, cannot be modified on this page.  Click on the
<span class="button">Details</span> button.
</p>
<p>If there are any individual event records in the event table these are
displayed in subsequent rows according to their defined order.  
The fields in which the information is displayed can be modified, and any
changes entered will be applied to the events when you click on the
<span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate&nbsp;Person</span> button, or using
the keyboard combinations Ctrl-S or Alt-U.
the person event records
may be reordered by date by clicking on the 
<span class="button"><u>O</u>rder Events by Date</span> button, or
using the keyboard combination Alt-O.
<p>After the person event records the next row
in the events display specifies the date and location
where the person died.  This row is always present even if the
information is unknown.
</p>
<p>The next row in the events display specifies the date and location
where the person was buried.  This row is always present even if the
information is unknown.
</p>
<p>The next row after the events list contains two buttons.
<ol>
    <li>The <span class="button">Add <u>E</u>vent</span> button 
    	pops up a <a href="/FamilyTree/editEventHelpen.html">dialog</a>
        that provides the
    	ability to add a new event.  This includes not only events
    	represented by records in the events table, but also the four
    	LDS sacraments.
    <li>The <span class="button"><u>O</u>rder Events by Date</span> button
    	reorders those events that are represented by records in the
    	events table by the date of the event.
</ol>
<h2>Other Details</h2>
<img src="/Images/EditPersonOther.png" alt="Other portion of Edit Person Dialog">
<p>On the next row of the dialog you can control the visibility
of information
about the person to casual visitors.  Note that all people less than
103 years old are automtically treated as private.  
By setting Private to "Yes" you can 
designate that a person older than 103 is to be handled the same way.
By setting Private to "Invisible" the very existence of the person is not
revealed.  
</p>
<p>If the "Never Married" checkbox is selected then the report on the 
individual will include a note that they were never married.  Note that 
this checkbox cannot be selected if the person is a spouse in a family.
</p>
<p>
The "User Reference" field is typically used to contain an identifier
that is significant to the author of the tree.  For example it may indicate
the relationship of the person to the author.
</p>
<p>

individual is the principle subject.
</p>
<p>a person may have an associated address record which provides more
detail about how to contact the person, which may include a detailed
surface mail address, phone numbers, an e-mail address, and a web page URL.
If such a record already exists for this individual the dialog displays an
