    <h1>Entering Dates: Help</h1>
    <p>This page documents in detail how to enter the date of an event.
    </p>
    <p>The basic date consists of a numeric day of the month, the name of a month, 
    and a numeric year.  The term "numeric" includes valid roman numerals.   That
    is roman numerals may be used anywhere in a date that an arabic number may
    be used.  For example "VI June MCMXLIV" and "VI/VI/MCMXLIV" are interpreted 
    as "6 June 1944".
    The following table outlines the supported month names:

    <p>The three components of the date may be arranged in any order:  day month year, month day year, year month day, and so on, as long as this does not make the date ambiguous.  Ordinal suffixes can be appended to day numbers (with or without a space separator).  Commas may be inserted where typically used. 
    The date is ambiguous if the year might be confused with a day
    of the month because it is in the range 1 to 31.  If the first part of the
    date is a number in this range
    then the date is assumed to be in the order day month year.  So 12 July 28 is
    interpreted as the 12th of July 28 CE, not as the 28th of July 12 CE.
    </p>
    <p>If you provide a month name from the French Republican calendar then
    The date is interpreted appropriately.  Note that no abbreviations are
    supported for these month names, although optionally the accents may be
    omitted.
    The last date for which the French Republican Calendar was in legal force was
    10 Nivôse XIV which was immediately followed by 1 January 1806.  The 
    application accepts higher year numbers, but the interpretation of the date
    is only a close approximation since we do not know when leap years would have
    been inserted after the 15th year of the calendar.
    </p>
    <p>Parts of the date may be omitted for the obvious reason that they may
    be unknown.  You can express a date as just the year or just the month and
    the year, or just the month and the day.  "7 Feb" is the 7th of February in
    an unknown year, while "Feb 7" is sometime during the month of February in the
    year 7CE.
    </p>
    <p>Vital statistics events registered in Britain and indexed on 
    microfilm and through FreeBMD
    are generally only known by the quarter in which they were registered.  Such
    a date should be entered as, for example: "1Q 1875" or "Q3 1856" and will be
    displayed as, for example, "in Q4 1887".
    </p>
    <p>Alternatively a date may expressed using a numeric month in place of
    the name, by separating the components with slashes.  This creates
    additional room for ambiguity.  The date can be expressed as yyyy/mm/dd,
    dd/mm/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy.  If either the first or last number is greater
    than 31 it is assumed to be the year.  If both of the first two numbers
    are less than or equal to 12, then the first number is assumed to be the
    day and the second the month, thus conforming to the date conventions of
    the majority of countries, although <b>not</b> of the USA.  That is in
    almost every country on Earth 2/3/2013 is the 2nd of March 2013, but in the
    United States of America it is the 3rd of February 2013.
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifiers</h2>
    <p>A date can be qualified by a prefix.  The following prefixes are
    supported:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th class="colhead">Prefix</th>	
        <th class="colhead">Interpretation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <th>On</th>		<td>ordinary date</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Abt</th>	<td>About</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>About</th>	<td>About</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Cir</th>	<td>Circa</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Circa</th>	<td>Circa</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Bef</th>	<td>Before</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Before</th>	<td>Before</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Aft</th>	<td>After</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>After</th>	<td>After</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Between</th>	<td>Between two dates</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Bet</th>	<td>Between two dates</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>WFT EST</th>	<td>World Family Tree estimate</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Est</th>	<td>Estimate</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Cal</th>	<td>Calculated from age at event date</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Calculated</th>	<td>Calculated from age at event date</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>From</th>	<td>From.  May be followed by to second date.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>To</th>		<td>To</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>If there is anything else before the date it will be saved and presented
    to users when the date is viewed.  For example a date: "On the morning of the 6th of June 1944" will be correctly interpreted internally as 6 June 1944, but
    will be presented in all web pages in the exact form it was initially
    entered.
    <p>A date can be enclosed in angle brackets '&lt;' and '&gt;' to indicate
    that it is estimated.  The date will be displayed with angle brackets around
    it.
    </p>
    <p>A date may be marked as questionable by following it by a question mark '?'.
    <p>The epoch of the date can be expressed as a suffix at the end of the
    date:
    <table>
      <tr><th>BC</th><td>Before Christ</td></tr>
      <tr><th>AD</th><td><i>Anno Domini</i> the Year of Our Lord</td></tr>
      <tr><th>CE</th><td>Common Era</td></tr>
      <tr><th>BCE</th><td>Before the Common Era</td></tr>
      <tr><th>AUC</th><td><i>ab Urbe Condite</i>Since the Founding of the City (of Rome)</td></tr>
      <tr><th>OS</th><td>Old Style.  This specifically refers to dates used
    	in the British Empire, including its American colonies, up until
    	1752.  In this period Britain continued to use the Julian Calendar
    	with the year commencing on March 25th.</td></tr>
      <tr><th>NS</th><td>New Style.  This indicates explicitly that a date
    	is in the Gregorian Calendar with the year starting on January 1st.
    	This is the default for all dates on or after 15th October 1582.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Internally all dates are represented as day, month number, and year
    according to the Julian Proleptic Calendar for all dates up to 4 October 1582
    and according to the Gregorian Calendar for all subsequent dates.
    <h2>Ranges</h2>
    <p>You can build up more complex dates by combining two
    of the basic dates as described above in one of the following
    date phrases:
