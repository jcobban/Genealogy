    <h1>Individual Web Page: Help</h1>
    <p>This page displays the information collected in the family tree database 
    about an individual and the family or families for which they are a parent
    in a textual form for easy reference.
    </p>
    <p>The title of the page contains the name and
    birth and death dates of the individual.  Note that if you are not an
    "owner" of the record for the individual and the person is still living, or
    lived recently, the dates are privatized and most other details about
    the individual are suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>The body of the page consists of four sections, two of which are only
    displayed if the the current user is authorized to access those functions
        <ol>
    	<li>A textual report on the individual.  This contains:
    	    <ul>
    		<li>The names of the parents of the individual, if known,
    		which are displayed as links to the individual web pages
    		of the parents.
    		<li>A list of known facts about the individual starting with
    		when and where the person was born, events during their life,
    		and ending with their death and burial.
    		<li>For each spouse or partner the name of the spouse is a 
    		link to the spouse's web page presented along with information
    		about their relationship including the date and place of 
    		marriage if known. 
    		<li>A list of known facts about the spouse in the same format
    		as for the current individual.
    		If known the names of the parents of the
    		spouse are presented, also as links.  
    		<li>A list of the children from the relationship, if any, 
    		with their birth and death
    		dates.  The entry for each child is a link to the page for
    		details about that child.
    	    </ul>
    	    <p>Each link to another individual in the tree is also a
    		mouse "hot-spot".  If you hold the mouse over the name 
    		of the individual for two seconds, a bubble pops up with
    		additional information about the individual.  This avoids
    		the requirement to actually follow the link to further
    		identify the individual.
