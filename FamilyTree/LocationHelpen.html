      <h1>Display/Edit Location: Help</h1>
      <p>Every location that is referenced by an event or fact in the 
        Family Tree is recorded in the Locations Master List. 
        This way all of the information
        collected about a particular location is centralized.  This,
        in particular, facilitates ensuring that particular locations
        are always identified in the same way.  If you change the location
        name then all events referencing that location are changes.
      </p>
      <img src="/Images/LocationEdit.png">
      <p>You get to this web page by clicking on the link on the numeric
        key field on the
        <a href="/FamilyTree/LocationsHelpen.html">Locations Master List</a>
        web page, or by clicking on the 
        <span class="button">Edit&nbsp;Location</span> button in the
        popup that appears if you hold the mouse over a location name.  
        If you are signed on as a contributor 
        the text and other fields
        on this page permit you to modify the characteristics
        of the location as shown above.  Otherwise the fields are
        all protected  as shown below.
      </p>
      <img src="/Images/LocationDisplay.png">
      <p>The following information is displayed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The unique internal numeric key of the location record.
          This is required to support having multiple locations with
          the same name.
        </li>
        <li>The location name as it appears in reports.  The only way to
          modify the appearance of the name is through this field.  In
          particular if you attempt to change the case of any letters in
          the location name as it appears in the description of any fact
          that change is ignored.  If you make any more substantive change
          to the location name in a fact,
          for example expanding an abbreviation, you create, or refer to, 
          a <b>new</b>
          location, distinct from the original.
        </li>
        <li>The short name is used only on input.  If you enter 
          a short name when
          editing a fact it is expanded to the full location name.
          For example you could define "Chicago" as a short name for the
          location "Chicago, Illinois, USA".
        </li>
        <li>The sort key is normally the same as the location name,
          but can be
          used to change how the location names are present in the
            <a href="/FamilyTree/LocationsHelpen.html">locations master list</a>.
          For example if you define "Saint Louis, Missouri, USA" as the
          sort key for "St Louis, MO, USA" then the location will sort in
          a more intuitive way.
        </li>
        <li>The search name is used when performing a geo-location search
          to obtain the longitude and latitude of the location.
        </li>
        <li>FS Place Id is not currently supported, but may be set for
          use by <a href="https://legacyfamilytree.com/">Legacy Family Tree software</a>.
        </li>
        <li>The Latitude and Longitude of the location.
          These values are shown and entered in degrees with decimal
          fractions. 
          These fields are normally set by manipulating the map
          displayed by the <span class="button">Show&nbsp;Map</span>
          button.
        </li>
        <li>Clicking on the <span class="button">Show&nbsp;Map</span>
          button pops up a map based on the supplied longitude
          and latitude,
          or if those have not yet been determined the Google maps 
          geo-coder is used to attempt to interpret the name
          of the location.
          You can manipulate this map to focus on the actual
          location based
          upon your knowledge. 
          See <a href="#map">Manipulating the Map</a>
          below for further details.
        </li>
        <li>The preposition field permits explicitly defining
          the preposition
          used before the location name in reports.  
          The default is "at" but,
          for example in English the preposition "in" is normally 
          used with
          geographically extensive locations, such as countries, states,
          provinces, and counties.
        </li>
        <li>The Zoom field is used to determine the area covered by the
          map displayed by on the 
          <span class="button">Show&nbsp;Map</span>
          button.  The higher the value, the smaller the area.  Level 1
          shows the entire world.  Level 12 covers a whole township 
          or medium
          sized city. Level 20 shows an individual house.
          This field is normally set by manipulating the map
          displayed by the <span class="button">Show&nbsp;Map</span>
          button.
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="button">Get&nbsp;Map&nbsp;Info</span> button
          adjusts the values of latitude, longitude, zoom,
          and the region boundary to correspond 
          to the displayed map as you have manipulated it.
        </li>
        <li>The notes field can be used to explain the usage of a location
          or for any other purpose you choose.
        </li>
        <li>The "Used" flag is used by LegacyFamily Tree software.
        </li>
        <li>The "Tag1" flag is used by Legacy Family Tree software.
        </li>
        <li>The "Verified" flag is used by Legacy Family Tree software.
        </li>
        <li>The "FSResolved" field is used by Legacy Family Tree software.
          It has the values 0=no, 1=yes, 2=could not be resolved.
        </li>
        <li>The "VEResolved" field is used by Legacy.
          It has the values 0=no, 1=yes, 2=could not be resolved.
        </li>
        <li>The "qsTag" flag is used by Legacy Family Tree software.
        </li>
        <li>As a result of editing location names it may happen
          that two or more
          locations end up with the same Location text.  This normally means
          that they are in fact two references to the same real location.
          When this occurs editing one of the locations results 
          in the display of a list
          of all higher numbered locations with the same location text,
          together with a <span class="button">Merge&nbsp;Duplicates</span> 
          button.  Clicking on this
          button merges all references to the higher numbered instances
          and deletes the higher numbered instances from the table.
        </li>
        <li>If you are authorized to update locations click on
          the <span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate Location</span> to apply
          changes you have made to the fields.
        </li>
        <li>The
          <span class="button">Display&nbsp;Individuals&nbsp;using&nbsp;this&nbsp;Location</span>
          button displays
          a <a href="/FamilyTree/getIndividualsByLocationHelpen.html">
          list of individuals and marriages</a> that reference
          this location.  You cannot delete a location that has any events 
          referring to it.  To delete a location you first select this hyperlink.
          If there are no references you are given the option of deleting
          the location.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="#map">Manipulating the Map</h2>
      <p>Clicking on the <span class="button">Show&nbsp;Map</span>
        button opens a view-port on a Google map. If you are not signed on
        to the site this looks like the following:
      </p>
      <img src="/Images/LocationMapDisplay.png">
      <p>This shows what the map will look like when requested by a
        user of the site when examining an event in the Family Tree.  The
        map is centered on the location.  If the location is an extended
        area, such as a city, county, or township, then this displays the
        boundary with the interior shaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are signed on as a contributor then you are given the
        ability to modify the map by manipulating this display.
      </p>
      <img src="/Images/LocationMapEdit.png">
      <p>
        This has a marker identifying the center of the map. 
        If this is not located on the most appropriate geographical
        position to represent the location name, use the mouse to drag
        the map so the desired position is in the center of the map window. 
        Do this by holding down the left mouse button while you move
        the mouse.  Zoom the map to the
        most appropriate level of detail using the '+' and '-' 
        map controls in the lower right.
      </p>
      <p>If the location represents a geographical region, such as
        a township, county, state, province, or country, then
        the boundary of the region should be defined.
        Identify successive points around the boundary of the region
        and click on
        them.  Go clockwise around the region.
        Do not close the boundary; leave the last side open; the application
        closes the polygon
        by drawing a straight (constant compass heading) line from the
        last point to the first point when 
        the boundary is displayed to visitors.  In the displayed example
        for the township of Etobicoke note that the application draws 
        this closing line  from the end, just below Pearson Airport, up
        to the first point, on Steeles Avenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you observe
        that a point on the boundary has been misplaced, you can drag
        that point to the correct position with the mouse.  You can
        also insert a new vertex between two existing positions
        by grabbing the dot at the middle of the line between them.
        Remember that clicking anywhere on the map adds a new line segment
        to the boundary starting at the current last position and going
        to the point you click.  There is currently no method for
        deleting a vertex from the list, only for dragging it
        to a new position.  
      </p>
      <p>If you click the mouse anywhere on the map the application
        adds a new point to the boundary after the last point.  This
        is convenient when creating a boundary in the first place but
        may not be desirable when updating an existing boundary.
