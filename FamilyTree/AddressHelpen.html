<h1>Display/Edit Address: Help</h1>
<p>Every address that is referenced in the family tree is
recorded in the Addresses Master List.  This way all of the information
collected about a particular address is centralized.  This,
in particular, facilitates ensuring that particular addresses are always
identified in the same way.
</p>
<p>An Address record can be used for one of three purposes:
<ol>
<li>As a more detailed alternative to a Location record.  A Location
record contains an unstructured line of text identifying the place where
an event took place, or a fact was observed.  An Address record breaks
the identification of the place into its hierarchical component parts.
<li>To record contact information for an individual in the family tree.
This should be used cautiously.  For example using a separate contact list
or "Rolodex"&trade;
application provides advantages, such as integration with address label or
bulk mail creation applications.  Furthermore placing personal information
of this sort in the family tree may expose it to an unintended audience.
<li>To record contact information for a repository, such as a library or
archive, which provides public access to source documents that are
referenced by the family tree.
</ol>
<p>You get to this web page by clicking on the link on the numeric
key field on the
<a href='AddressesHelpen.html'>Addresses Master List</a> web page,
or by clicking on the button associated with "Address" on the
<a href='editIndividHelpen.html'>edit Individual page</a>.
If you are authorized the text and other fields on this page permit you to
modify the characteristics of the address.  Otherwise the fields are
all protected.  The following information is displayed:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The unique numeric key of the address record, called the IDAR.
    <li>A selection list for the 'kind' of address.  Mailing address records
	are used to record the mailing address of individuals in the
	family tree.  Event address records are used in place of location 
	records to represent the place where an event took place or
	a fact was observed with more details than a location record
	can contain.  A repository address record is used to record the
	physical (or electronic) location of a copy of a source document.
    <li>The style field indicates whether this address should use the
	North American style of postal addresses or the European style.
    <li>The address name as it appears in reports.  The only way to
	modify the appearance of the name is through this field.
	Note that when you first add a mailing Address onto an individual
	the address name is initialized to the name of the individual.
	In most cases that is desirable, but for very common names
	such as "Donald McDonald" you may end up with two Address
	entries with the same name, which will cause endless confusion.
    <li>The sort key is normally omitted, but can be
	used to change how the address names are present in the
	  <a href='AddressesHelpen.html'>addresses master list</a>.
	For example if you define "Saint Louis, Missouri, USA" as the
	sort key for "St Louis, MO, USA" then the address will sort in
	a more intuitive way.
    <li>The components of the address as it would be used for surface
	mail.
    <li>Two phone numbers associated with the address record.
    <li>An electronic mail address associated with the address record.
    <li>A web-site uniform record locator associated with the address record.
    <li>The Latitude and Longitude of a address are normally filled in
	by a geo-location service. The format is degrees including a decimal
	fraction.
    <li>The <span style='button'>Show Map</span> button pops up a map
	showing the location.
    <li>The <span style='button'>Get Map Info</span> button copies information
	from the displayed map into the record.  This avoids going to the
	external geo-location service every time the
	<span style='button'>Get Map Info</span> button is clicked.
    <li>The Zoom specification defines the level of detail of the displayed
	map.
    <li>You can define a preposition to use when presenting the address as
	part of another web-page.
    <li>The notes field can be used to explain the usage of a address
	or for any other purpose you choose.  This is a
<a href='https://www.tinymce.com/'>"What You See is What You Get"</a> 
editor that you can use like a
word processor.  You can highlight text as <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, 
or <u>underlined</u>.
You can change the <span style='color:red;'>color</span>,
<span style='background-color: yellow'>background</span>,
<span style='font-size: smaller;'>size</span>,
and even the
<span style='font-family: courier monospace sans-serif; font-size: larger'>font
 for text</span>.
You can use pre-defined styles which combine a set of features.
You can insert numbered or unnumbered lists.  You can define
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink'>hyper-links</a> 
to other locations anywhere on the World-Wide Web.  You can insert images
by referencing their location on the web and control how they are presented
within the page.
    <li>The "List 1" through "List 6" flags are used by Legacy.
    <li>The "Used" flag is used by Legacy.
    <li>The "Tag1" flag is used by Legacy.
    <li>The "Verified" flag is used by Legacy.
    <li>The "FSResolved" field is used by Legacy.
	It has the values 0=no, 1=yes, 2=could not be resolved.
    <li>The "VEResolved" field is used by Legacy.
	It has the values 0=no, 1=yes, 2=could not be resolved.
    <li>The "qsTag" flag is used by Legacy.
  </ul>
</p>
<p>As a result of editing address names it may happen that two or more
	addresses end up with the same Address Name text
	and the same 'kind' of address.  This normally means
	that they are in fact two references to the same real address.
	When this occurs editing one of the addresses results 
	in the display of a list
	of all higher numbered addresses with the same address name,
	together with a "Merge Duplicates" button.  Clicking on this
	button merges all references to the higher numbered instances
	and deletes the higher numbered instances from the table.
</p>
<p>There are four buttons at the bottom of the page:
  <ul>
    <li>If you are authorized to update addresses click on
	the "Update Address" to apply changes you have made to the
	fields.
    <li>If you are authorized to update the address click on the
	"Delete Address" to remove the record.  If you are editing the
	Address associated with an individual then this also updates the
	individual, and the "Edit Address" button in the page for updating
	the individual changes to read "Add Address".  Note that to clear
	the reference from the Individual to the Address you need to
	update the individual.
    <li>You can click on "Close without Updating" to no apply any changes
	to the database.
    <li>The "Pictures" button opens a page displaying the associated
	media documents associated with this address.
  </ul>
