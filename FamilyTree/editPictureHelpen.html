<h1>Edit Picture: Help</h1>
<p>This page documents the dialog that is displayed when you
click on the <span class="button">Edit Picture</span> button associated
with the media file 
on the <a href="/FamilyTree/editPicturesHelpen.html">edit pictures</a> page.
<p>The "FileType" selection list permits you to identify the type of
data in the media file.  The web site supports image
files, sound clips, and video clips as supported by your browser.
Other file types may be supported in future.
<p>The Image URL field identifies the location of the media file on the web.
This is usually an absolute URL, starting with "http:", or "https:", or "ftp:".
A relative URL is supported but only for media files that are actually stored
on the site itself.
<p>Clicking on the <span class="button">Browse</span>
button after the Image URL input field opens up another browser window
which can be used to locate the desired media file.  When using the browser
remember that you are not copying the actual media file, but only the URL
of the media file.
<p>The media file is displayed in the next line if it is an image.  For an
audio or video clip a set of controls is presented so you can listen to or
view the clip.
<p>The Caption field permits you to edit the caption that is displayed with the
media file.  The caption also appears in the listing in the
<a href="/FamilyTree/editPicturesHelpen.html">edit pictures</a> dialog.
<p>The Date field is a convenient place to put the date that the media file was
originally captured.  This is displayed with the caption when the
media file is displayed, and may be used to order the media files
in chronological order in the
<a href="/FamilyTree/editPicturesHelpen.html">edit pictures</a> dialog.
<p>The Description field provides an area for an extended discussion of the
media file contents.  This information is displayed as a text paragraph
below the media file, and after the caption when the media file is presented
as part of a record on the web.
<p>The Print field is a checkbox.  If it is selected then if the media file is
an image it is printed along with the record it is contained in.
<p>You may record 
the URL of a sound clip that is associated with the media file as an
audio caption.
<p>Clicking on the <span class="button">Browse</span>
button after the Sound File URL input field opens up another browser window
which can be used to locate the desired sound file.  Again remember to copy
the URL of the sound file, not the file itself.
<p>The Preferred field is a checkbox.  If it is selected then this media file
is included with the display of the containing record even if no other 
media files are presented.
<p>The Filing Ref field is for the researcher's own identification system.
For example this could record the physical location of the original media.
<p>Clicking on the <span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate Picture</span> button,
or entering the Alt-U keyboard shortcut, saves the changes you have made to
this picture.
