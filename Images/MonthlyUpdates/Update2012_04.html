<H1 CLASS="western">Linking Between the Family Tree and the Source
Transcriptions</H1>
<P>The latest enhancements to the <A HREF="http://www.JamesCobban.net/">www.JamesCobban.net</A>
family history web-site are focused on increasing productivity by
establishing linkages between the raw source document transcriptions
and the family tree.  There are two sides to this:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>The footnotes for the main page of an individual which refer
	to primary source documents that are transcribed on the web-site are
	interpreted, where possible, as links directly to the specific page
	of the source document.</P>
	<LI><P>When viewing a transcription of an original document where
	possible the fact that this original document contains information
	about an individual in the family tree is highlighted, and a
	mechanism provided to view the information in the family tree.</P>
</OL>
<P>These linkages change how almost all of the tools work.  As
mentioned above the footnotes now include links to the individual
pages of the transcriptions:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_m6443cb08.png" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=575 HEIGHT=245 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>Clicking
on the registration number link for the death registration displays:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_m4ee3c500.png" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=538 HEIGHT=172 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Note the link back to the page in the family tree.</P>
<P STYLE="page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: avoid">Clicking
on the link to the 1881 Census displays a summary of the whole
matching page:</P>
<P STYLE="page-break-after: avoid"><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_68b1fb2e.png" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=433 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Observe how in those lines that have had linkages established to
the family tree the name is a link to the family tree page for the
individual, as indicated by the underlining and the brighter color. 
This is done for all report responses.  For example if you search for
marriages involving “John Cobban” the response is:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_m6eb9aaf9.png" NAME="graphics9" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=553 HEIGHT=153 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The hyperlinked names take you to the family tree information.  If
you click on the “Details” button, the marriage details page now
shows:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_m30701ad2.png" NAME="graphics10" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=280 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>This shows the new links to the family tree for both the bride and
groom.</P>
<P>I have attempted to automate the establishment of these linkages
as much as possible, however there are a lot of places where a
judgment call is required, and computers are notoriously lacking in
their ability to make such decisions.  The next section of this
report discusses how to ensure that these features are available to
users of the web-site.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Defining a Citation so it will be Interpreted as
a Link</H2>
<P>When you define a citation to one of the original source documents
that are transcribed on the site you must use a fairly rigid format
of the page number information, so the web server software can
correctly interpret the linkage.</P>
<P>For <B>Ontario Birth, Marriage, and Death registrations</B> the
page number should be the registration number stamped on the original
document and the year of registration in the format yyyy-nnnnn, for
example 1883-12345.  The year must be 4 digits long, for obvious
reasons.  That must be followed by a hyphen with no spaces around it.
 The registration number is more fluid, since actual registration
numbers have between 4 and 7 digits, and the registration number does
not have to be the last thing in the page number, although anything
following the registration number is ignored.</P>
<P>There are issues with the Ancestry indexes, and the associated
images.  The volunteers who created this database and assembled the
images ignored the year of registration and the registration number
when capturing the information.  The images are organized by the year
of the <B>event</B>, not the year of <B>registration</B>.  Frequently
events from previous years were registered in a later year.  The
Ontario Registrar even has a special procedure for handling this with
registration numbers starting with a 9 for registrations delayed by
one year, and 5 for registrations delayed more than one year.  Less
frequently sloppy township clerks did not forward the registrations
until early in the new year, and therefore events registered in a
particular year may have taken place early in the following year! 
Furthermore in the period around the “turn of the century”, from
the 1890s to the 1900s, the standard forms required 2 pages to record
all of the information, and frequently the image of the page
containing the actual registration number is not even present on the
Ancestry site.</P>
<P>For <B>Canadian Census</B> records a specific line, recording
information about a single individual, can be uniquely identified in
all censuses by:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>The district number, which is almost always an integer, but
	in a couple of cases sloppy administration led to districts with a
	“½” appended.  It makes you wonder, how exactly does one miss
	an entire federal riding when organizing the census?</P>
	<LI><P>The sub-district identifier.  For 1851, 1861, 1906, 1911, and
	1916 this is an integer, for 1871, 1881, 1891, and 1901 it is
	usually a letter, although various kluges were used to handle more
	than 26 sub-districts in a district. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If a sub-district was too large to be handled by a single
	enumerator a division number.  In some cases in the 1911 census,
	which officially had no enumeration divisions, some moron at the
	Dominion Bureau of Statistics lumped together sub-districts that had
	been handled by the same person, even if they were not contiguous
	geographically.  This creates a problem that page numbers and family
	numbers repeat within the same sub-district.  AutomatedAncestry.com
	tried handling this by adding a large number onto the page numbers
	and family numbers to make them distinct within the sub-district,
	but this creates a problem that the page numbers within the
	sub-district are not continuous.  For example page 17 might be
	followed by page 101!  Since my web-site uses a consistent
	implementation across all censuses, the division number is present
	in the internal implementation of the 1911 census, so I have chosen
	to invent division numbers to deal with this cock-up. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Within a single enumeration division the pages are
	sequentially numbered.  In most censuses the enumerator wrote the
	page number on  each form, however in the pre-Confederation censuses
	this was not done consistently, and when the original documents were
	micro-filmed in the 1950s a number was rubber-stamped on each page. 
	However since the original documents had not been bound into books,
	they are frequently not in any intelligible order, which creates
	chaos when families run over the end of a page.  Moreover the
	technicians doing the micro-filming were not consistent in how they
	numbered the pages.  The information about an individual is spread
	over the front and back (<I>recto</I> and <I>verso</I>) of the form
	and some technicians numbered both sides, which causes the page
	numbers to increment by 2 in the database.</P>
</OL>
<P>So in citing a fact about an individual to a census it is
necessary to provide all <B>four</B> pieces of information to
identify where in the census the information is located.  The
web-site expects the citation page number for a census to look like:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.2in; page-break-before: auto">dist 99 optional-dist-name, subdist X optional-subdist-name, div 9 page 99</PRE><P>
If the sub-district is not organized into divisions the div portion
may be omitted.  For pre-Confederation censuses, a 2-character
abbreviation for the colony name (e.g. CW) precedes the district
portion.</P>
<P>For convenience an appropriate citation string appears at the top
and bottom of the page whenever you are viewing a page of the
transcription, or the detailed information from a single line of any
census.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Linking from the Source Document to the Family
Tree</H2>
<P>All of the database tables recording source document
transcriptions now support an explicit link to the associated
individual in the family tree.</P>
<P>For <B>Ontario Birth, Marriage, and Death registrations</B> since
the year of registration and registration number uniquely associate
the registration with a single individual, who was born or died, or
pair of individuals, who were married, the links from the
transcriptions of the registrations to the associated individuals
have been set up automatically for all  citations that already used
the proper form of identification as discussed above.  Furthermore
every time you add a new citation to a birth, marriage, or death
using the proper format the transcription record is automatically
linked to the family tree.</P>
<P>There are a few minor issues, however:  Because of information
missing from the Ancestry database some birth, marriage, and death
citations do not currently have a proper page reference.  In other
cases there were typing errors in entering the page reference.  A few
page references have the year and number reversed, such as
12345-1874.  Because of the way the server code is written if you
determine the correct reference it is necessary to delete the old
incorrect citation and enter a new citation with the correct page
reference in order to establish the link.</P>
<P>For <B>Canadian Census</B> records such an automatic linkage is
not possible, since the citation only identifies the page, and there
are up to 50 individuals recorded on each page.  It would be far too
tedious to demand that every census citation identify the specific
line in the census.  Human intervention is required to introduce the
necessary judgment into this process.</P>
<P>Some additional tools have been added to the page that is used for
editing the transcription of a page of a census.  Firstly at the top
of the page there are now three buttons:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_3197e6a7.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=564 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>When you click on “Match Family Tree Citations” the site
searches the family tree database for all citations to the current
page for births or individual events and attempts to match  the
individual against the people recorded on the page.  A report of
successful matches is presented in a separate window.  This is a
relatively conservative process, that is the individuals must match
fairly closely on name, gender, and age.  As a result it is quite
safe to click on this button.</P>
<P>Now look way to the right-hand edge of the page, which will
probably require horizontal scrolling.  There you will see a whole
new column that looks like:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_1042217d.png" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=98 HEIGHT=123 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The column heading “FT” stands for “Family Tree” and this
column displays the status of linkages to the family tree database on
a line by line basis.</P>
<P>Clicking on a “Show” button opens a new window containing the
standard display of information from the family tree about the
individual associated with this line of the census.  If there is no
such linkage the button displays “Find”.  Clicking on the “Find”
button searches the family tree database for potential matches.  This
is a fairly loose search that will likely find multiple matches.  For
example a database surname of “Greggor” will match, among other
things, “McGregor”  It is your responsibility to examine the
response to see if one of the responses actually is the individual
described by the census.</P>
<P STYLE="page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: avoid">For
example the response might look like:</P>
<P STYLE="page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: avoid"><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_m3e8923db.png" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=318 HEIGHT=173 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Select the line that you are confident matches the census:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_7780a56.png" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=344 HEIGHT=169 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>Then
click on the “Select” button.  If you do not choose a line first
clicking on the “Select” button just closes the dialog without
updating the database.</P>
<P>If no individual in the family tree database matches the line in
the census the application displays:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="2012AprilUpdate_html_m311cae83.png" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=330 HEIGHT=123 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
