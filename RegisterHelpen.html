	databases.
    <li>Post blogs related to individual records in the family tree.

	of which you have been granted shared ownership because you have
	demonstrated to an existing owner that you have a close
	relationship.
    <li>Update individual records in the family tree of which you have been
	granted ownership.  This includes adding new immediate relatives, such
	as spouses, parents, or children.

<p>To register as a user of the web site you must supply:
<ul>
    <li>The user identifier by which you wish to be known to the web site.
	This is up to 64 characters long, however you
	may prefer to keep this short, as you must enter it
	each time you sign on to the web site.  Your browser may
	assist you with remembering this.  This identifier must be
	unique within the web site.  If the value you supply is not
	acceptable to the implementation the text will be highlighted in
	red.
    <li>The password that you wish to use when you identify yourself to the
	web site.  This is at least 6 characters and at most 32 characters
	long.
    <li>Repeat the supplied password.
    <li>The E-mail address at which you wish to be contacted as part of the
	registration process.  This is up to 256 characters long.
	You will be able to change this later
	using the <a href="/AccountHelpen.html">account management web page</a>.
	If the value you supply is not
	acceptable to the implementation the text will be highlighted in
	red.
    <li>A checkbox where you can choose whether or not to receive regular
	notices about changes to the web-site at the registered e-mail address.
</ul>
<p>Then click on the "Register" button at the bottom of the page body.
If there is a problem a message is displayed and you are given the opportunity
to correct the registration.  Otherwise you are directed to respond to the
e-mail that will be sent to you to confirm your registration.
</p>
<p>Clicking on the "Close" button closes this dialog without registering
the user.
