    <p style="margin-top: 0.17in"><b>Selected Achievements</b></p>
    <p><b>After</b> joining my first employer out of University, Centennial Community
      College in Toronto, I revolutionized the entire information technology infrastructure
      of the College, doubling the productivity of the entire student records administration.  
      As a result at the age of 25 I was in charge of all Information Technology
      for the College including the consolidated catalogue of all Ontario Community College libraries.
    </p>
    <p><b>Created</b> tools which facilitated the management of the first shared network for
      financial services in the world provided by the largest computer service company in Canada at the time, Datacrown.</p>
    <p><b>Created</b>
      a GUI wrapper around the communication services provided by Datacrown.
      This GUI wrapper implemented much
      of the functionality incorporated a decade later into the World Wide Web, including
      using text files to organize content and connecting those pages by links.</p>
    <p><b>Led</b>
      major communications software product development projects for
      Nortel Networks. Products delivered on time and within budget while designed
      for easy evolution.  These products generated $10 billion in revenue.
      The forethought in my designs meant that the
      products were frequently in advance of customer expectations.
      For example one time I was asked to create external and internal design
      documents to be presented to a customer the very next day for a
      requested feature. I replied that in fact I had already considered that
      and the functionality the customer wanted was part of the
      existing product. I spent a half hour modifying the customer documentation
      to describe the functionality and Nortel billed the customer $250K.</p>
    <p><b>Led
    </b>a project to define the management and service delivery architecture
      for new product line for Nortel. This product line became the basis
      for all new business-oriented data communications products.</p>
    <p><b>Developed</b>
      Web services, including financial services, for a multi-level marketing service
      focussed on SMS messaging.
