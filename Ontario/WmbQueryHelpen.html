        <h1>Wesleyan Methodist Baptisms Query: Help
        </h1>
    <p>The associated panel permits searching my private copy of the database of 
    Ontario Wesleyan Methodist Baptisms.
    <p>About 1996 Ida Reed decided she would like to have something to do at home in her spare
    time, so she purchased the four reels containing the Wesleyan Methodist Baptismal
    Register. It took her at least two years of continually transcribing from the machine to
    the computer, at all hours of the day. She bought her own microfilm reader in order
    to do this.
    <p>The data are Â© Ida Reed, 2001. The information may be copied for personal use only, 
    not for resale.
    <p>Source for the 4 reels of film was:
    
    <p>Victoria University Archives
    <br>73 Queen's Park Cresent
    <br>Toronto, Ontario
    <br>M5S 1K7
    <p>Telephone (416) 585-4563
    
    <p><a href="/Ontario/http://www.united-church.ca/local/archives/on/holdings/loan" target="_blank">
    United Church Archives</a>.
    <br>email <a href="/Ontario/mailto:archives@united-church.ca">Archives</a>
    
    
    <p>The 4 reels of film that comprise the source of Ida's work can also be
    obtained from the LDS church using the following film numbers:-
    
    <p>Vol. 1, baptisms, 1825-ca. 1860                 FHL #1759292
    <p>Vol. 2, baptisms, 1840's-ca. 1870               FHL #1759293
    <p>Vol. 3, baptisms, 1850's-1870's                 FHL #1759294
    <p>[Locality index to vol. 3]                      FHL #1698106 Item 3
    <p>Vol. 4, baptisms, 1860's-1910 	                FHL #1759295
    
    <h2>The Query Dialog</h2>
    <p>The input fields on the panel permit you to restrict the response to
    baptisms that match any combination of the following criteria:
    <p><span class="label">Count:</span>
    Permits specifying the maximum number of matching entries to display at a time.
    The default is 20 at a time. 
    <p><span class="label">District:</span>
    If specified limits the response to baptisms registered within a particular
    district.  The arrangement of districts changed from time to time since after
    all the political administration of the province or UpperCanada / Canada West /
    Ontario also changed over the years covered by the database. 
    The value
    entered here is a string that matches against part of the name of the district.
    So entering 'Middlesex' matches against any district name that contains the
    text 'Middlesex'.
    <p><span class="label">
    Area:
    </span>
    If specified limits the response to baptisms recorded in the specific
    lower level geographical area, typically a township.
    The value
    entered here is a string that matches against part of the name of the area.
    So entering 'West' matches against any district name that contains the
    text 'West'.
    <p><span class="label">Name: Given:</span>
    If specified limits the response to baptisms of individuals whose given name
    matches the specified pattern.
    The value is a regular expression.  In particular if a simple string is
    given it matches all names that contain the string.  For example "fred"
    matches "frederick", "freddie", and "alfred", among other names.
    <p><span class="label">Name: Surname:</span>
    If specified limits the response to baptisms of individuals whose family name
    matches the specified pattern.
    The type of search depends upon the value specified
    here and if the Soundex option is selected. In particular if the value is
    composed
    of letters of the alphabet and spaces then only names that match exactly will be
    included, except if the Soundex option is specified.
    However if value contains characters that have a special meaning in
    regular expressions
    then a pattern match it performed.   For example ".*smith$"
    matches names that end in "smith".
    <p><span class="label">Soundex:</span>
    If this option is checked then the Soundex algorithm is used to make the 
    surname search based on sound rather than an exact match.
    <p><span class="label">Father:</span>
    If specified limits the response to baptisms of individuals whose 
    Father's name matches the specified pattern.
    The value is a regular expression.  In particular if a simple string is
    given it matches all names that contain the string.
    <p><span class="label">Mother:</span>
    If specified limits the response to baptisms of individuals whose 
    Mother's name matches the specified pattern.
    The value is a regular expression.  In particular if a simple string is
    given it matches all names that contain the string.
    <p><span class="label">Residence:</span>
    If specified limits the response to baptisms of individuals whose 
    parent's residence matches the specified pattern.

    given it matches all places that contain the string.
    <p><span class="label">Birth Place:</span>

    matches the specified pattern.

    given it matches all birth places that contain the string.  For example 
    "m.*x" matches "middlesex", "msx", and "msex", among others.
    <p><span class="label">Birth Date:</span>
    If specified limits the response to baptisms of individuals whose birth date 
    matches the specified value.  The date is expressed in the form "yyyy-mm-dd".
