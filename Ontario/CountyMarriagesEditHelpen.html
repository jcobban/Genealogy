        <h1>County Marriages Edit Form: Help
        </h1>
      <p>This page permits updating the database of
    pre-Confederation Marriage Registrations which consists of annual
    reports from ministers of religion or other marriage registrars.
    These reports are organized by Militia District up to 1858 for Upper Canada 
    and by County from 1858 to 1869 for Canada West.  These
    reports contain less information than the post-confederation registrations,
    and are organized differently.
      <p>The form is presented in two slightly different formats depending upon
    the selection criteria:
      <ul>
        <li>If the request limited the search to marriages within a single
    	report, that is within the marriages performed by a particular
    	minister of religion within a particular year, then the minister
    	of religion, his affiliation, and normal residence are displayed
    	at the top, and the title of the page contains the identification
    	of the specific report.
    	<br>
    	Furthermore a navigation line appears above the tabular report
    	providing a link to the preceding item or report, and a link to
    	the next item or report, depending upon whether a specific item
    	was identified in the request.
    	Also a button is displayed to view the original image if defined.
    	<br>If the identified report does not yet exist in the database
    	then an empty form with 10 items is displayed.
        <li>Otherwise the information for identifying the report within which
    	each marriage registration is contained is displayed as 
    	three columns at the beginning of each line of 
    	the marriage registration.
      </ul>
      <p>Each row of the displayed table of information includes:
      <ol>
        <li>If the search request did not identify a specific report
    	a column to display the domain name.
        <li>If the search request did not identify a specific report
    	a column to display the volume number.
        <li>If the search request did not identify a specific report
    	a column to identify the report by number.
        <li>The item number within a particular minister's report.  Each
    	item includes two rows, one with information about the groom
    	and one containing information about the bride.
        <li>The role is either 'B' for bride, or 'G' for groom.
        <li>The given names of the spouse.
        <li>The surname of the spouse.
        <li>The age of the spouse if it was provided in the original document.
        <li>The residence of the spouse.  Special attention should be paid
    	to the residence of the bride.  Since these reports do not identify
    	where the marriage took place, it is most probable that the marriage
    	took place either at or near the residence of the bride.
        <li>The birth place of the spouse if it was provided in the 
    	original document.
        <li>The name of the father of the spouse if it was provided in the 
    	original document.
        <li>The name of the mother of the spouse if it was provided in the 
    	original document.
        <li>The date of the marriage.  The value entered in the row for
    	the groom is copied into the row for the bride.
        <li>An indicator of whether the authorization for the marriage was by
    	Banns, 'B', or by license, 'L'.  The value entered in the row for
    	the groom is copied into the row for the bride.
        <li>The name of a witness to the marriage.
        <li>A space for remarks.  Editorial remarks should be entered in square
    	brackets.
        <li>Clicking on the  <span class="button">Details</span> button 
    	displays a form with the details of this particular marriage
    	registration.  At present this is performed by limiting the
    	response to the two lines of the specific marriage registration.
        <li>Clicking on the <span class="button">Delete</span> button 
    	deletes both the bride and groom records.
        <li>A button for linking to the family tree.  If this displays
    	a button showing "Find" then clicking on the button searches 
    	the family tree for potential matches.<br/> 
    	If this displays a button showing "Tree" and a button showing
    	"Clear" then clicking on the "Tree" button displays an existing 
    	individual in the family tree, and clicking on the "Clear"
    	button removes the linkage to the family tree and resets the
    	cell to contain the "Find" button.
      </ol>
      <p>You can change the value of any of the fields except the item number
        and role.
        If you enter an unusual value in a field, the color of the text changes
        to red or if already colored to identify the role of the individual
        in the marriage, the text becomes bold, to warn you. 
        Many of the fields also have a list of abbreviations
        that are expanded.  For example the date column expands abbreviations for
        for the months.</p>
      <p>To add additional records just press enter while the text cursor is in
        any field in the last row of the table.  Pressing enter in any other row
        moves the focus down to the 'Role' field of the next row of the table.</p>
      <p>Clicking on <span class="button"><u>U</u>pdate Database</span>
        commits the changes you have made to the database.
        The page also supports the keyboard short-cuts Ctrl-S and Alt-U.
      </p>
      <p>Since not all of the columns are present in all original reports you
        can hide the columns that are not available by clicking in the column header
        cell.  If you later change your mind and wish to see the contents of the
        column you can click in the now narrow column header cell.
