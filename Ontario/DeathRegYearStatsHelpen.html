  <h1>Death Registration Status by Year: Help
  </h1>
    <p>The associated panel displays an overview of the progress
	of the transcription effort for Ontario death registrations
	for a particular year.
    <p>
	<img src="DeathRegYearStats.png"
		alt="Death statistics for Year screenshot">
    <p>For each registration city, town, or township, 
	this page displays:
    <ul>
	<li>The county name.
	<li>The name of the city, town, or township.
	<li>the number of death
	registrations that have been transcribed.  To be considered as
	transcribed at least the name of the deceased has
	been transcribed.
	<li>The lowest registration number for the town or township.
	<li>The highest registration number for the town or township.
	<li>The ratio of the number of registrations that have been
	transcribed to the number of registrations between the lowest and
	highest registration number, which gives a measure of what
	proportion of the registrations have been transcribed, as a percentage. 
	<li>The percentage of those transcriptions that have been
	linked to corresponding records in the family tree.  These
	cells are color-coded to visually indicate the degree of
	completeness, from dark red for townships where there are no
	links to the database through bright green for townships where
	all of the deaths have been linked.
	<li>Clicking on the <span class="button">View</span> button
	displays a <a href="/Ontario/DeathRegRespHelpen.html">
	summary of the transcriptions</a> for that
	particular place of registration.
    </ul>
  <p>At the bottom a summary row is displayed.  This displays:
    <ul>
      <li>The total number of transcriptions for this year.
      <li>The lowest registration number transcribed.
      <li>The highest registration number transcribed.
      <li>The ratio of the number of transcriptions to the total number of
	transcriptions between the lowest and highest registration numbers,
	which gives a measure of the proportion of registrations that have
	been transcribed in that range, as a percentage.
      <li>The percentage of transcribed registrations that have been linked
	to the family tree.
    </ul>
