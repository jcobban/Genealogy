      </h1>
        <p>The associated panel displays an overview of the progress
    	of the transcription effort for the domain marriage registrations
    	for a particular year.

        <p>For convenience there are arrow links for proceding directly to
    	the status summary for the preceding and following years.
        <p>For each county in the domain this page displays:
        <ul>
    	<li>An abbreviation for the county name.
    	<li>the number of individuals for whom marriage
    	    registrations have been transcribed.  To be considered as
    	    transcribed at least the date of the marriage has
    	    been transcribed. 
    	<li>The lowest registration number in the county.
    	<li>The highest registration number in the county.
    	    Note that sometimes the registrations are not contiguous
    	    in number.
    	<li>The percentage of those registrations that have been
    	    transcribed.
           	    These cells are color-coded to visually indicate the degree of
    	    completeness, from dark red for counties where there are no
    	    records transcribed through bright green for counties where
    	    all of the marriages have been linked.
    	<li>The percentage of those transcriptions that have been
    	    linked to corresponding records in the family tree.
           	    These cells are color-coded to visually indicate the degree of
    	    completeness, from dark red for counties where there are no
    	    links to the database through bright green for counties where
    	    all of the marriages have been linked.
    	<li>Clicking on the <span class="button">View</span> button
    	    displays a <a href="/Ontario/MarriageRegYearCountyStatsHelpen.html">
    	    statistics of the transcriptions</a> for that
    	    particular county.
