      <h1>Ontario Hospital Employee Ledger: Help
      </h1>
        <p>This page represents the transcription of one page of an
          employee register for an Ontario Mental Asylum/Hospital.
          Each line in this register represents a single employee who
          worked at the specific institution.
        </p>
        <p>The Page number within the employee register is displayed above
          the table.  Clicking on the &lt;-- arrow at the left of this 
          row takes you to the next lower page within the register.
          Clicking on the --&gt; arrow at the right of this 
          row takes you to the next higher page within the register.
        </p>
        <p>The top row of the table displays the column headings.  Since
          the display of the entire table does not fit into a standard 
          1920 pixel wide display without zooming out you can temporarily
          hide any column that you are not interested in by clicking on 
          the column header.  Clicking on the narrow space where the
          column header was previously displayed restores the column.
        </p>
        <p>Each row of the table displays information on one employee,
          starting with the employee number, given name, surname, and
          the age when hired.
        </p>Between the Surname and Age columns of each row there is 
          a buttonÂ which indicates  whether this employee is also a member
          of the family tree.  
        </p>
        <p>
          If this employee is not associated with a
          person in the family tree then the button displays
          <span class="button">Find</span>.  Clicking on the button
          performs a search of the family tree for a person matching
          the name and birth year of this employee.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this employee is associated with a person in the family tree
          then the button displays
          <span class="green button">Show</span>.  Clicking on the
          button displays the page for that person in the right side
          of the browser window.
        </p>
        <p>While in any of the table fields the keys behave like they
          do in a spreadsheet program.  In particular the up and down
          arrow keys move to the same cell in the preceding or following
          row of the table.  The Enter key takes you to the same cell
          in the next row of the table.  The Home key positions the
          data entry to just before the first character in the current
          input cell.  Ctrl-Home takes you to the beginning of the
          Given Name field in the current row.
        </p>
        <p>To apply the changes you have entered click on the
          "Update" button below the bottom of the table.
