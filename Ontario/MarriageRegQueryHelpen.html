      <h1>Marriage Registration Query: Help
      </h1>
        <p>The associated panel permits searching the database of Ontario
    	Marriage Registrations.
        <p><span class="label">Identification:</span>
    	Permits searching for marriage registrations by specifying the year 
    	of registration and the number assigned by the Ontario Registrar 
    	when the records were indexed starting in the 1950s.  Specifying
    	the registration year and number limits responses to the records 
    	with registration number between the specified value, and that number 
    	plus the value of Count minus one. 
        <p><span class="label">Count:</span>
    	Permits specifying the maximum number of matching entries to display
    	at a time.  The default is 20 at a time. 
        <p><span class="label">Registration: County:</span>
    	This selection list is used to limit the response to marriages 
    	registered in the selected county.
        <p><span class="label">
    	Registration: Township:
          </span>
    	For some counties this is a selection list of the recognized towns
    	and townships in the selected county.  For others it is a text entry
    	field where you may type the name of the township.  If a township
    	is specified in either way, the response is limited to marriages 
    	registered in the specified city, town, or township.
        <p><span class="label">Name: Given:</span>
    	Specify a value here to limit the response to marriages of 
    	individuals whose given name matches the specified pattern.
    	The value is a regular expression.  In particular if a simple string
    	is given it matches all names that <b>contain</b> the string.  For 
    	example 'fred' matches 'Frederick', 'Freddie', and 'Alfred',
    	among other names.  The search is case insensitive.
        <p><span class="label">Name: Family:</span>
    	If specified limits the response to marriages of individuals whose
    	family name matches the specified pattern. The type of search depends 
    	upon the value specified here and whether the 'Soundex' option is 
    	selected. In particular if the value is composed of letters of the 
    	alphabet, the apostrophe ('), and spaces then only names that match 
    	exactly are included, except if the 'Soundex' option is specified.  
    	However if the value contains characters that have a special meaning in 
    	regular expressions then a pattern match it performed.   
    	For example '.*smith$' matches names that <b>end</b> in 'smith',
    	including 'Smith'.
        <p><span class="label">Soundex:</span>
    	If this option is checked then the Soundex algorithm is used to make 
    	the surname search based on sound rather than an exact match.
        <p><span class="label">Roles: Husband:</span>
    	If this option is checked, then the response will include grooms
    	who match the other criteria.
        <p><span class="label">Roles: Wife:</span>
    	If this option is checked, then the response will include brides
    	who match the other criteria.
        <p><span class="label">Roles: Minister:</span>
    	If this option is checked, then the response will include ministers
    	who match the other criteria.
        <p><span class="label">Birth Year:</span>
    	Specify this to limit the response to individuals whose calculated
    	year of birth is within 'Range' years of a particular year.
        <p><span class="label">Range:</span>
    	Specify this to limit the response to individuals whose calculated
    	year of birth is within this many years of the specified 'Birth Year'.
        <p><span class="label">Marriage Place:</span>
    	If specified limits the response to marriages of individuals whose
    	marriage place matches the specified pattern.  The value is a 
    	case-insensitive regular expression.  
    	In particular if a simple string is given it 
    	matches all marriage places that <b>contain</b> the string. 
    	For example specifying 'london' matches all marriage places containing
    	'london' or 'London'.
    	As a more sophisticated example 
    	'm.*x' matches places whose name contains the letter 'm' or 'M' and 
    	where somewhere later in the place name there is a letter 'x' or 'X',
    	for example 'Middlesex', 'Msx', and 'Mexico', among others.
        <p><span class="label">Marriage Date:</span>
    	If specified limits the response to marriages of individuals whose 
    	marriage date matches the specified pattern.  The value is a 
    	regular expression.  In particular if a simple string is given it 
    	matches all dates that <b>contain</b> the string.  For example
    	specifying '1882' will match all dates in 1882.
    	Specifying 'Mar' matches all marriages taking place in March.
    	Specifying 'Mar.*1882' matches all marriages in March of 1882.
        <p><span class="label">Father: Name:</span>
    	If specified limits the response to marriages of individuals whose 
    	Father's name matches the specified pattern.
    	The value is a regular expression.  In particular if a simple string is
    	given it matches all names that <b>contain</b> the string.
    	As a suggestion, since the surname of the party to the marriage is
    	generally the same as the father's surname, it is more efficient to
    	only specify the father's given name here.  For example to find 
    	marriages of the children of 'John Smith' specify 'smith' in the
    	individual's family name field, and 'john' in this field.
        <p><span class="label">Mother: Name:</span>
    	If specified limits the response to marriages of individuals whose 
    	Mother's name matches the specified pattern.
    	The value is a regular expression.  In particular if a simple string is
    	given it matches all names that <b>contain</b> the string.
    	As a suggestion: to find the marriages of all children of 'John &amp; 
    	Mary Smith' specify 'smith' in the individual family name field, 'john'
    	in the father's name field, and 'mary' in the mother's name field.
        <p><span class="button">Query</span>

    	by pressing the Enter key while the input focus is in a text field.
        <p><span class="button">Clear Form</span>
    	Clicking on this button resets the input fields to their default values.
        <p><span class="button">Status</span>
