        <h1>Marriage Registration Details: Help
        </h1>
      <p>The associated panel permits updating the database of
    Ontario Marriage Registrations.
      <p><span class="label">Navigation:</span>
    There are three navigation buttons at the top of the page:
      <ul>
        <li>Clicking on <span class="button"><u>P</u>revious</span> 
    	displays the registration with the next lower registration
    	number within the current year.
    	You may also use the keyboard shortcut Alt-P.
        <li>Clicking on<span class="button"><u>N</u>ext</span> 
    	displays the registration with the next higher registration
    	number within the current year.
    	You may also use the keyboard shortcut Alt-N.
        <li>Clicking on<span class="button">New <u>Q</u>uery</span> 
    	displays the <a href="/Ontario/MarriageRegQueryHelpen.html">Marriage Registration
    	Query</a> dialog.
    	You may also use the keyboard shortcut Alt-Q.
      </ul>
      <p><span class="label">Identification:</span>
    This row of the display identifies the specific registration
    by specifying the year of 
    registration and the number assigned by the Ontario Registrar when the records
    were indexed.
      <p><span class="label">Microfilm Volume:</span>
    This identifies the Ontario Archives microfilm volume number containing the
    original image of the registration.
      <p>
      <p><span class="label">Registration: County:</span>
    This is a selection listing all of the counties and districts in Ontario.
    For an existing record the county specified in that record is selected.
    For a new record the county specified in the existing record with the
    highest registration number less than the current record is selected.
    This is because registrations from a particular county, or district, always
    have contiguous registration numbers.
      <p><span class="label">
    Registration: Township:
      </span>
    This is usually a selection list of all of the villages, towns, townships, 
    and cities within the county that at some period had a clerk collecting
    registrations.  If a county is not selected 
    or if the township name is misspelled in the existing record 
    then this is a text input field.
    For an existing record the township specified in that record is selected.
    For a new record the township specified in the existing record with the
    highest registration number less than the current record is selected.
    This is because registrations from a particular clerk generally
    have contiguous registration numbers.
    Clicking on this button performs the query.  This may also be requested by
    pressing the Enter key while the input focus is in a text field.
      <p><span class="label">Marriage: Date:</span>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p><span class="label">Marriage: Place:</span>
