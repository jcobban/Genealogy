      <h1>Death Registration Query: Help
        </h1>
      <p>The associated panel permits searching my private database of Ontario Death Registrations, focussing on Middlesex County.
      <p><span class="label">Identification:</span>
    Permits searching for a particular death registration by specifying the year of registration and the number assigned by the Ontario Registrar when the records
    were indexed and microfilmed in the 1950s.
    Specifying the registration year
    and number limits responses to the records with registration number between the
    specified value, and that number plus the value of Count minus one. 
      <p><span class="label">Count:</span>
    Permits specifying the maximum number of matching entries to display at a time.
    The default is 20 at a time. 
      <p><span class="label">Registration: County:</span>
    If specified limits the response to deaths registered in the specified county.
      <p><span class="label">
    Registration: Township:
      </span>
    If specified limits the response to deaths registered in the specified city,
    town, or township.  For some counties this item is presented as a selection
    list.
      <p><span class="label">Name: Given:</span>
    If specified limits the response to deaths of individuals whose given name
    matches the specified pattern.
    The value is a regular expression.  In particular if a simple string is
    given it matches all names that contain the string.  For example "fred"
    matches "frederick", "freddie", and "alfred", among other names.
      <p><span class="label">Name: Family:</span>
    If specified limits the response to deaths of individuals whose family name
    matches the specified pattern.
    The type of search depends upon the value specified
    here and if the Soundex option is selected. In particular if the value is composed
    of letters of the alphabet and spaces then only names that match exactly will be
    included, except if the Soundex option is specified.
    However if value contains characters that have a special meaning in regular expressions
    then a pattern match it performed.   For example ".*smith$"
    matches names that end in "smith".
      <p><span class="label">Soundex:</span>
    If this option is checked then the Soundex algorithm is used to make the 
    surname search based on sound rather than an exact match.
      <p><span class="label">Sex:</span>
    If specified limits the response to deaths of individuals whose sex matches the
    specified value.
