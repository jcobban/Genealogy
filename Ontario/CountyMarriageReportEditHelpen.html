      <h1>County Marriages Report Form: Help
      </h1>
      <p>This page permits viewing and updating the list of annual reports
        from ministers of religion or other marriage commissioners
        (Justices of the Peace) from pre-Confederation Marriage
        Registrations that were reported to county registrars in
        Canada West between 1858 and 1867.  These annual reports contain
        less information than the post-confederation marriage
        registrations, and are organized differently.
      <p>This form is presented when you query the pre-Confederation County
        Marriages and supply only the Domain and optionally the Volume
        number.
      <img src="/Images/CountyMarriageSummary.png">
      <p>Each row of the displayed table of information includes:
      <ol>
        <li>The volume number which identifies a bound volume at the
            Archives of Ontario which contains marriage reports.
        <li>The sequential Report Number within the volume
    	    assigned to the list of marriages
    	    performed by a minister or marriage commissioner during a year.
        <li>The given names of the minister or marriage commissioner.
        <li>The surname of the minister of marriage commissioner.
    	    brackets.
        <li>The number of marriages in the report which have been
            transcribed.
        <li>The color-coded percentage of the transcribed marriages which
            have been linked to the family tree.
        <li>Clicking on the <span class="button">Details</span> button
            presents <a href="/Ontario/CountyReportDetailsHelpen.html">
            a form containing the information recorded about
            the marriage officiant</a> who submitted the report.
        <li>Clicking on the <span class="button">Marriages</span> button 
    	    displays <a href="/Ontario/CountyMarriagesEditHelpen.html">
    	    the list of marriages contained in the particular report</a>.
        <li>Clicking on the <span class="button">Delete</span> button 
    	    deletes information about the marriage officiant.  This does
            delete the marriage transcriptions but they become inaccessible
            until the marriage officiant record is re-added.
      </ol>
      <p>You can correct the value of the report number, page number,
        or the name of the marriage officiant on this page.
        If you enter an unusual value in a field, the color of the text
        changes to red to warn you.
      </p>
      <p>To add an additional record change the empty last record in
        the display, where it says "New Minister".
      </p>
      <p>Clicking on <span class="button">Update Database</span>
        commits the changes you have made to the database.
        The page also supports the keyboard short-cuts Ctrl-S and Alt-U.
