        <h1>Death Registration Details: Help
        </h1>
    <p>The associated panel permits updating the database of
    Ontario Death Registrations.
    <p><span class="label">Navigation:</span>
    There are three navigation buttons at the top of the page:
    <ul>
        <li>Clicking on <span class="button"><u>P</u>revious</span> 
    	displays the registration with the next lower registration
    	number within the current year.
    	You may also use the keyboard shortcut Alt-P.
        <li>Clicking on<span class="button"><u>N</u>ext</span> 
    	displays the registration with the next higher registration
    	number within the current year.
    	You may also use the keyboard shortcut Alt-N.
        <li>Clicking on<span class="button">New <u>Q</u>uery</span> 
    	displays the <a href="/Ontario/DeathRegQueryHelpen.html">Death Registration
    	Query</a> dialog.
    	You may also use the keyboard shortcut Alt-Q.
    </ul>
    <p><span class="label">Identification:</span>
    This row of the display identifies the specific registration
    by specifying the year of 
    registration and the number assigned by the Ontario Registrar when the records
    were indexed.
    <p><span class="label">Registration: County:</span>
    This is a selection listing all of the counties and districts in Ontario.
    For an existing record the county specified in that record is selected.
    For a new record the county specified in the existing record with the
    highest registration number less than the current record is selected.
    This is because registrations from a particular county, or district, always
    have contiguous registration numbers.
    <p><span class="label">
    Registration: Township:
    </span>
    This is usually a selection list of all of the villages, towns, townships, 
    and cities within the county that at some period had a clerk collecting
    registrations.  If a county is not selected 
    or if the township name is misspelled in the existing record 
    then this is a text input field.
    For an existing record the township specified in that record is selected.
    For a new record the township specified in the existing record with the
    highest registration number less than the current record is selected.
    This is because registrations from a particular clerk generally
    have contiguous registration numbers.
    Clicking on this button performs the query.  This may also be requested by
    pressing the Enter key while the input focus is in a text field.
    <p><span class="label">Given Name:</span>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p><span class="label">Death Date:</span>

    as documented by the popup help balloon.
    </p>
    <p><span class="label">Death Place:</span>
    <p>
    The place where the death took place.
    Clicking on the <span class="button">Clear&nbsp;Form</span> button resets

    </p>
    <p><span class="label">Link:</span>
    <p>
    If this registration has been cited in the family tree as documentation for
    a death, then a hyperlink is provided to the family tree page for the
    deceased.  Otherwise if possible a selection list of entries in the family
    tree that resemble this death are displayed so you can choose one.  Choosing
    an entry adds a citation to this death registration onto the deceased's record
    in the family tree.
