        <h1>County Marriage Query Form: Help
        </h1>
      <p>This page permits requesting to view or update a set of
    pre-Confederation Marriage Registrations which consists of annual
    reports from ministers of religion or other marriage registrars submitted
    to county registrars in Canada West between 1858 and 1867.  These
    reports contain less information than the post-confederation registrations,
    and are organized differently.</p>
      <p>You can search for marriage registrations using several fields:
      <ol>
        <li>There is a selection list of supported administration domains. 
    	However the only domain which is known to use the information
    	structure supported by this part of the application is
    	the Canada West pre-Confederation Marriages.
    	<br>If this is all you supply then the response is a
    	<a href="/Ontario/CountyMarriageReportEditHelpen.html">list of all reports
    	for this administrative domain</a>.
        <li>You can limit the response to marriages recorded in a particular
    	bound volume of these records by supplying the volume number. 
    	<br>If you supply only the domain and volume number then 
    	the response is a
    	<a href="/Ontario/CountyMarriageReportEditHelpen.html">list of all reports
    	within the volume</a> in order by report number.
        <li>Within a particular volume you can limit the response to a
    	particular report by report number.  Each report consists of
    	a list of marriages performed by a particular minister of religion
    	or marriage commissioner (Justice of the Peace) within a particular
    	year, since each minister was supposed to submit this report at the
    	end of the year.
    	<br>If you supply the domain, volume number, and report number then 
    	the response is a
    	<a href="/Ontario/CountyMarriagesEditHelpen.html">list of all marriages
    	within the report</a> in order by item number.
        <li>The given names of a spouse. 
    	This will return a
    	<a href="/Ontario/CountyMarriagesEditHelpen.html">list of all spouses
    	</a> matching the given names.
        <li>The surname of a spouse.
    	This will return a
    	<a href="/Ontario/CountyMarriagesEditHelpen.html">list of all spouses
    	</a> matching the family name.
      </ol>
      <p>Clicking on <span class="button">Query</span> button, or pressing
         the Enter key initiates the report.</p>
      <p>Clicking on <span class="button">Clear Form</span> button resets all 
         input fields to their defaul values.</p>
      <p>Clicking on <span class="button">Status</span> button 
         displays a report of those volumes of county marriage reports that
         have been partially transcribed.</p>
