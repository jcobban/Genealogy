<h1>Contact Author: Help</h1>
<p>This dialog provides the ability for a user to send a message to
the owners of a particular page in the web site.
</p>
<p>You get to this dialog by clicking on the button on the "Contact Author"
link in the bottom portion of any page.
Initially the dialog looks like:
</p>
<img SRC="contactAuthor.png" alt="Contact Author screenshot">
<p>It displays descriptive information about the page that referred you.
This is most commonly the name of the referring script or web page, but
in some cases it is a phrase with human meaning.  For example if you
clicked on the "Contact Author" link at the bottom of a page describing
an individual in the family tree, then this descriptive phrase includes the
name and dates of the individual, as well as the internal unique key.
<ul>
    <li>If you are a casual visitor to the site, that is you are not
	a registered contributor, then you are asked for your e-mail
	address so that the author can contact you.
    <li>An area for entering your text message.  The first part of this
	is pre-initialized to the descriptive text for the referencing
	page.
</ul>
<p>Then click on the <span class="button">Blog</span> 
button at the bottom of the page body to send an internal message to
the author or authors of the referencing page.
</p>
<p>For any other issue click on the "Contact Author" hyperlink in the
page footer.
