      <h1>Spreadsheet Programs in Genealogy</h1>
      <p>A common use of computer spreadsheet
		programs is to organize data collected from original sources.  A
		spreadsheet is a natural representation of many forms of data.  In
		particfular any data set that represents answers to a specific set of
		questions can naturally be organized using a spreadsheet.  This
		includes surveys, censuses, birth certificates, marriage licenses,
		death certificates, directories, and lists of electors  in
		particular.  Spreadsheets have also been used effectively to
		represent cemetery transcriptions, although the inconsistency in how
		information about individuals is represented creates some
		limitations.</p>
      <p>Generally when you purchase a new
		computer it comes with a copy of an office suite.  Since marketers
		are trying to minimize the price of their products this is generally
		the cheapest suite that they can obtain a license for.  Typically
		this means that it is one of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a back-level release of Corel®
        	WordPerfect Office.  This is provided in order to entice you to
        	later buy a more current release.</li>
        <li>The Microsoft® Works suite.  Despite the marketing logo this product
        	was not developed by Microsoft, and it is not compatible with
        	Microsoft® Office, with the exception of the copy of Microsoft®
        	Word that is included.  Again the purpose is to entice the customer
        	into later purchasing the much more expensive Office suite.</li>
        <li>Lotus Office.  This is included only on computers bought
          through an IBM retailer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of these applications provide
		similar basic capability, which is all that you are typically going
		to use in genealogy.  However they are all, to some extent,
		deliberately frustrating.  So sooner or later you are likely to be
		considering an upgrade to a more comprehensive package.  In this
		article I discuss three specific options:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Quattro Pro; part of the Corel®
      	WordPerfect Office.  The latest version, incorporated into
      	WordPerfect Office X7, can be downloaded from
        <a href="http://www.wordperfect.com/">www.wordperfect.com</a>
      	for Cdn$249.</li>
      <li>Microsoft® Excel; part of the Microsoft® Office.  The latest version,
      	incorporated into Microsoft® Office 365, can be downloaded from
      	<a href='www.microsoft.com'>www.Microsoft.com</a>
      	for US$99 a year (about Cdn$120).</li>
      <li>OpenOffice,
      	currently represented by OpenOffice 4.1.1 from Apache.  The latest
      	version can be downloaded from
      	<a href='www.openoffice.org'>www.OpenOffice.org</a>
      	for free.</li>
      <li>LibreOffice,
      	currently represented by LibreOffice 4.4 from The Document
      	Foundation.  The latest version can be downloaded from
      	<a href='www.libreoffice.org'>www.LibreOffice.org</a>
      	for free.  This is a community supported split from the an earlier
      	version of OpenOffice.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>To understand some of the
		idiosyncrasies of these applications a little history is useful.</p>
      <p>The first popular computer
		spreadsheet program, introduced in 1978, was VisiCalc.  It was
		conceived by Daniel Bricklin of the Harvard Business School.  
		Although VisCalc introduced the idea of an electronic spreadsheet, it
		failed to take advantage of the opportunities of the swiftly changing
		marketplace of the early 1980s. One artifact of this program
		continues to be supported by all of its successors.  If you start a
		field value with an apostophe (single quote) it will disappear when
		you leave the cell.  This is because VisiCalc used the apostrophe as
		a signal to left align the value in a cell.  This can be annoying if
		you are trying to record a value that actually starts with a single
		quote.</p>
      <p>In 1982 Lotus Coporation was founded
		to produce and market a spreadsheet program called 1-2-3 to emphasize
		its ease of use.  Lotus 1-2-3  was the most popular spreadsheet
		application on the old DOS based computers.  It provided a lot of
		features that made it an effective business tool, such as integrated
		plotting.  The rights to Lotus 1-2-3 were acquired by IBM in 1995.</p>
      <p>When Microsoft moved to focusing on
		the graphical Windows interface they did not have a large installed
		base of office suite users to worry about, and their primary concern
		in developing the components of their new office suite was to sell
		the new Windows operating system.  Therefore Microsoft® Excel
		concentrated on getting the best possible graphical user interface on
		the new product, even if this resulted in a less convenient keyboard
		interface.  This proved to be a wise decision, as Excel is, by far,
		the most successful spreadsheet program.</p>
      <p>Quattro Pro is the direct lineal descendant of the
        Borland Quattro spreadsheet program that was developed for
		MS DOS about 25 years ago.  The name implied that it was allegedly
		superior to Lotus 1-2-3, which was the most popular spreadsheet
		application at the time. When it was adapted to run on Microsoft
		Windows a marketing decision was made to maintain as much
		compatibility in keystroke sequences as possible.  Quattro Pro, and
		WordPerfect Office in general, are therefore particularly popular
		with users who like to do as much work with their hands on the
		keyboard as possible, rather than taking a hand off to work the
		mouse.</p>
      <p>OpenOffice was developed by Sun
		Microsystems to provide capabilities similar to Microsoft® Office,
		but on a operating system independent platform.  If Microsoft had
		been willing to adapt their Office suite to the UNIX environment they
		might have made OpenOffice irrelevant.  OpenOffice is now supported
		by Apache, the same organization that supports the Apache web server
		that is the basis of almost every web site on the planet.  Its
		objective is to implement a complete office suite that can run on any
		platform.  If a user finds that it is missing some desirable
		capability, they can add it themselves, and then contribute the new
		capability to the market.</p>
      <p>LibreOffice is an essentially
		identical product to OpenOffice, starting with the same shared source
		code.  It was split off from OpenOffice mostly because the license
		conditions imposed by Apache when it took control of OpenOffice were
		problematic for some distributors.</p>
      <p>All of these products can open and save
		spreadsheets in the industry standard Excel format, and the newer
		Excel 2007 format.  The native file
		format for OpenOffice and the Excel 2007 file format use 
		eXtended Markup Language (XML) to represent the structure
        of the information. 
		Using XML file formats reduces the size of
		files while making the delivery of new functionality easier.  More
		significantly, perhaps, it means that 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools can
		be easily created to perform functionality that is not available from
		the office suite itself.</p>
      <h3>Auto-Formatting</h3>
      <p>Spreadsheet programs provide you with
		a lot of control over the appearance of cells.  If you do not
		explicitly customize a cell the program tries to guess from the data
		that you enter into the cell what formatting you would like. 
		Sometimes this works well, and other times it does not.</p>
      <p>Frequently when entering ages a
		census enumerator will express the age of young children as a
		fraction, for example “3/12” to indicate a child that is 3 months
		old.  By default, however, all spreadsheet programs interpret this as
		a date!  So as soon as you enter the value it is changed to
        “03/12/15” which is either March 12th or the 3rd of December 
        depending upon
		where you live.  In Microsoft® Excel you may specify an
		age field to have a custom formatting of “# ?/12”.  Doing so has
		the advantage that you can perform arithmetic and comparisons on the
		values.  However this option is not currently supported by either
		Quattro Pro or OpenOffice.  An alternative that does not require
		fiddling with the cell formatting is to express ages in months as,
		for example “3m”.</p>
      <p>The following table shows the results
		of entering particular values into cells that have been explicitly
		formatted as “text” or as “custom” with a format string of “#
        ?/12”.  Note that any fractional value is displayed as the closest
		fraction with a denominator of 12.</p>

      </table>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>Many genealogical data sources
		contain dates.  These cause a problem for all spreadsheet programs
		because, by default, they are recognized as dates and internally
		encoded so they can be compared, sorted, and subtracted from each
		other.  However the internal format adopted for dates is the number
		of days since 1 Jan 1900.  When you enter an earlier date, for
		example “15 July 1874” it is treated as a string and left as you
		entered it, but any later date is translated and then displayed in
		the format chosen for the cell.  For example by default “15 July
		1974” is translated and displayed as “15-Jul-74”.  Dates that
		do not include a year are assumed to be for the current year, which
		is not displayed.  I generally explicitly flag the entire column as
		containing “text” to defeat this automatic conversion.  
      </p>
      <p>Note that OpenOffice differs from
		Excel and Quattro Pro in that it does support dates prior to 1 Jan
		1900 and stores them internally as the appropriate negative number of
		days.  That means that all dates subsequent to the switch to the
		Gregorian Calendar can be compared and sorted correctly in
		OpenOffice.  However if you open such a file using  Microsoft® Excel
		it will not be able to interpret the value.</p>
      <h3>Adding Comments to Cells</h3>
      <p>Frequently when transcribing data
		into a spreadsheet there is additional information that cannot be
		represented as part of the value of the cell.  After all the normal
		rule is that, as far as possible, a transcription should represent
		the document being transcribed.  For example if the original document
		gives someone's name as “Jhon Simht”, then that is what should be
		entered into the spreadsheet, even if you are absolutely convinced
		that the original author intended to write “John Smith”.</p>
      <p>Most spreadsheet applications provide
		a way to add comments to a cell.  These comments will appear in a
		floating bubble any time the cursor hovers over the cell in question.
        In Quattro Pro and Excel these are called “Comments”, and are
		added by “Insert/Comment”.  In OpenOffice these are called
        “Notes”, and are added by “Insert/Note”.  Regardless they all
		inter work.</p>
      <p>I have used these in a number of
		places to explain cells:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where
        	the original says “Mrs. John Smith” I sometimes add a note
        	“should be Jane Smith” or even “née Jane Jones”</li>
        <li>Where
        	I know, from evidence outside the document in question, that the
        	enumerator or clerk made a mistake, I enter the value as supplied by
        	the author, but add a note with the suggested correction.</li>
        <li>Where
        	the original is illegible I add a note “covered by ink blot”,
        	“erased by enumerator”, or just “bad handwriting makes it
        	unintelligible”.</li>
        <li>However
        	where the author has scratched out an entry I indicate this by using
        	the text formatting features of the spreadsheet to draw a line
        	through the value.</li>
        <li>Where
        	the author ignored published instructions on how to fill in the
        	form, and leaving the author's erroneous value in place would impair
        	the use of the data, I put a “corrected” value in the call, and
        	use the comment to record what the author actually wrote.  For
        	example in an ethnicity column I might enter “English” as the
        	value with a comment “actually 'England'”</li>
        <li>Where
        	the value entered is now considered pejorative I “correct” the
        	value while retaining the original in a comment.  For example I
        	adjust “Welch” to “Welsh”.</li>
        <li>Where
        	the cell should only have certain values, but the enumerator has
        	inserted something abnormal or additional.  For example marital
        	status should be “S”, “M”, “W”, or (rarely) “D”.  In
        	one case the enumerator entered the letter “M” but added, in
        	fine print “Separated from wife”.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Auto-Completion</h3>
      <p>One
		feature of spreadsheet programs that can save a lot of effort is
		auto-completion.  Auto-completion tries to “guess” the complete
		value of a cell based upon the first few keystrokes you enter.  The
		algorithm for completing the value is different in each application. 
		Indeed if a new spreadsheet program came on the market that exactly
		duplicated the behavior of an existing program it would probably
		result in a lawsuit.</p>
      <p>To compare the effectiveness and
		intuitiveness of the algorithms in the various implementations,
		imagine that you have a column that represents a month.  For
		simplicity we will assume that the only values that may occur in this
		column are: blank, “Jan”, “Feb”, “March”, “April”,
        “May”, “June”, “July”, “Aug”, “Sept”, “Oct”,
        “Nov”, and “Dec”.</p>
      <p>For effectiveness let us consider the
		number of keystrokes required to enter each of the months into
		subsequent cells of the column.</p>
      <p>On <b>Quattro Pro</b>
		auto-completion is case sensitive.  That means, for example, that if
		you start a new cell with a lower-case “j” it will not match to
		any of the already entered values.  The Quattro Pro algorithm matches
		to the most recent matching entry.  This works well when, for
		example, entering surnames in a census, but not so well when entering
		given names or months, which are essentially random.  
      </p>
      <p>For this kind of data the Quattro Pro
		algorithm is less intuitive than some of the other products.  The
		user cannot depend upon the exact result of a series of keystrokes,
		because the algorithm depends upon the history of what has been
		entered into the previous cells in the column, not just the set of
		values in the column.  Starting a cell with an uppercase “J” will
		result in one of “Jan”, “June”, or “July”.  Therefore if
		you are typing while not looking at your computer screen, for example
		you are either looking at the keyboard or at the original source you
		are copying from, then you must type 4 keystrokes for all three of
		those months to ensure that you get the right month.  Furthermore if
		you accidentally forget to hold down the Shift key while typing the
		first character, auto-completion will not work.</p>
      <p>
      <b>Microsoft®
		Excel</b>
		requires you to type enough characters to uniquely recognize an
		auto-completion value.  Excel is not case sensitive in recognizing
		partial values.</p>
      <p>Excel's support for multiple
		spreadsheets within a file means that it does not use cell values
		that are separated by blank rows from the cell that you are typing
		into as part of the auto-completion algorithm.  This can cause
		problems with data that has blank rows, for example many censuses. 
		In this case I sometimes have temporarily entered non-blank values
		into a blank row just to get Excel to recognize that the entire
		worksheet is a single table.  Although Excel is not case sensitive in
		auto-completion if it does not auto-complete a value, even if the
		complete value does match, then it does not apply the capitalization
		that you entered previously.  In our example this applies to the
		month “May”.  You must type all 3 letters to distinguish it from
        “Mar[ch]”, but having entered all 3 letters, if you forgot to
		hold down shift you get “may” in the cell.</p>
      <p>
      <b>OpenOffice</b>, and the derived <b>LibreOffice</b>,
		has a possibly unfair advantage.  It was developed more than a decade
		after either of the others and therefore could take advantage of a
		lot of user experience.  Microsoft, for example, could not change its
		auto-completion algorithm without upsetting its hundreds of millions
		of loyal customers.  The OpenOffice auto-completion algorithm is
		simply to match to the value that has the lowest sorting order.  In
		addition the Tab key can be used to sequence in alphabetical order
		through all of the matching values. This is also the most intuitive
		algorithm because you always know exactly what result you will get
		for a particular keystroke sequence.</p>
      <p>
		The overall effectiveness of
		the three algorithms are compared in the following table.</p>

      <h3>Organizing Data for Effective Auto-Completion</h3>
      <p>Auto-completion works best when there
		are a relatively small number of distinct values that are possible in
		the column, with few distinct values that start with the same
		characters.  The set of month names used in the previous comparison
		is an example of such a set.</p>
      <p>In a field containing a date within a
		year, for example the birth date field in the 1901 Census of Canada,
		you can run into problems even with the text format setting because
		of auto-completion.  For example if you have previously entered a
		value “March 12” into such a column and you then enter “March
		1” it will be auto-completed to “March 12”.  You need to pay
		close attention to see if this is happening to you.  To avoid this I
		recommend always putting the day before the month, even if the
		original source has it the other way around.  Since there are 366
		different valid values, not counting blank and “don't know”
		values, auto-completion does not work well in such a column until you
		have entered a lot of values, so you will generally end up typing
		every value completely, although Quattro Pro and OpenOffice may
		correctly expand the month.  
      </p>
      <p>As an experiment I have tried
		dividing such a date column into separate month and day columns. 
		This permits autocompletion to work on the month names, as described
		above.  However the additional cursor movements to move through two
		columns means there is no saving in total effort.</p>
      <p>In the 1901 census of Canada the
		birthplace column contains two pieces of information, the location
		and, for places within Canada, whether the birthplace was rural or
		urban.  If both pieces of information are entered into the same
		column of the spreadsheet extra work is created with both Quattro Pro
		and Excel.</p>
      <p>In the case of Quattro Pro as soon as
		you type the initial upper case “O”, it will guess that you want
		to repeat the last value starting with “O”, for example “Ontario
		r.”.  But if you actually want to enter “Ontario u.” you must
		continue typing until you reach the “u”.  That is you must type 9
		keystrokes (including the shift) every time the value changes. 
		Alternatively you may type “O” then tab, which takes you to the
		end of the auto-completed value, and then backspace to replace the
        “r”.  That is 4 (or 6 if you include the period) keystrokes to
		change entries.</p>
      <p>Excel will not do any autocompletion
		until you get to either the “r” or the “u”.  That is you must
		type at least 8 keystrokes on every entry starting with “Ontario”.</p>
      <p>In the case of OpenOffice it takes
		one keystroke, “o” to get “Ontario r.” and two keystrokes,
      “o” and tab, to get “Ontario u.”</p>
      <p>If this single column is divided into
		two columns, one for the location and one for the urban-rural
		indicator, then Excel and Quattro only need a single keystroke in
		each of these columns to fill in the values.  Fortunately there are
		very few cases where a particular character starts multiple
		countries, the most common I have encountered is “S”, which
		starts “Scotland”, “Sweden”, and “Switzerland”.</p>
      <p>On a column containing names of
		religions I find there are a lot starting with “C”.  These
		complicate auto-completion  Ignoring various abbreviations these
		include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>C. Apostolic</li>
        <li>C.C. Baptist</li>
        <li>Canadian Methodist</li>
        <li>Canadian Presbyterian</li>
        <li>Catholic</li>
        <li>Christian</li>
        <li>Christian Science</li>
        <li>Church of England</li>
        <li>Church of Scotland</li>
        <li>Congregationalist</li>
        <li>Covenanted Baptist</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I try to minimize these situations by
		substituting other values that do not create this problem.  For
		example for “Church of England” I substitute “Anglican”, and
		for “Catholic” I substitute “Roman Catholic”.  In the latter
		I am also making a theological statement.  Technically all Christians
		who recognize the Nicene Creed are Catholics, since it contains the
		statement “I believe in one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.”</p>
      <p>Another issue is with the various
		competing branches of the Methodist church.  Some enumerators
		entered, for example:</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>Meth.
      	<li>Meth. N.C.
      	<li>Meth. E.
      	<li>Meth. W.
      </ol>
      <p>However the second represents the
        “New Connexion Methodist Church”, and therefore should be
		properly abbreviated as “N.C.Meth.”, while the last represents
		the “Wesleyan Methodist Church”, which should be abbreviated
        “W.Meth.”.  Making these substitutions reduces the number of
		keystrokes.</p>
      <p>In the “Profession, occupation, trade ...” column of a census you
		frequently see the following values:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Farmer
      	<li>Farmer's son
      	<li>Farmer ret.
      </ul>
      <p>In Microsoft® Excel you will be forced to type the entire word
        “Farmer” every time.  It will only autocomplete the entry when
		you enter the next character.  In Quattro Pro it will guess the last
		such value you entered as soon as you type the “F”.  You can then
		press Tab to go to the end of the value and either continue typing
        (if Quattro guessed “Farmer”) or backspace to correct the guess. 
		OpenOffice or LibreOffice will guess “Farmer” as soon as you type 
        the “F”
		and you can use the Tab key to select one of the other two values.</p>
      <h3>Other Issues</h3>
      <p>For
		sophisticated users be aware that, naturally, OpenOffice and Quattro
		do not support using VBA scripts for office automation tasks.  Doing
		so would be a violation of Microsoft copyrights.</p>
