      <h1>Digital Representation in Genealogy</h1>
      <p>We live in a digital age.  Almost
		everyone carries around at least one electronic device, such as a
		smart-phone or tablet, and many family historians have a laptop or
		home computer.  Although we live in a golden age of access to
		information, including information of genealogical interest, this
		information is frequently available only in inconvenient forms.  This
		article is an effort to explain both to the users of digital
		databases, but even more importantly to the publishers of these
		databases, the advantages and disadvantages of various
		representations of information.</p>
      <p>Whether distributed as traditional
		paper books, as digitized transcriptions on CDs or DVDs, or on web
		sites as either displayed pages or downloadable datasets, most
		sources organize data collected from original sources.  Some are pure
		textual sources, for example correspondence and books.  Others are
		tabular documents that represent answers to a specific set of
		questions.  This includes surveys, censuses, birth certificates,
		marriage licenses, death certificates, municipal directories, phone
		books, cemetery registers or transcriptions, and lists of electors
		among many others.</p>
      <p>Traditionally
		these datasets were recorded on paper, whether hand-written,
		type-written, or type-set.  Paper documents are durable, we have many
		paper documents from thousands of years ago such as the Dead Sea
		Scrolls or Egyptian hieroglyphic scrolls.  As long as paper is
		protected from damp, insects, and fire it will last essentially
		forever.  However paper documents are difficult for humans to search,
		and impossible for computers to read, except for those documents that
		have been typed or type-set.  Even if literally converted to
		electronic documents by text recognition software or human
		transcription the documents remain of only limited usability because
		the original documents were not designed to be searched.  An
		interesting example is the correspondence of Canadian Prime Minister
		William Lyon McKenzie-King.  Because his handwriting was
		idiosyncratic his secretary typed out a copy of everything he wrote. 
		This typed version has been read by text recognition software and
		used to create a searchable index of the hand-written correspondence.
      </p>
      <p>Despite
		the wonderful results that current search engines, such as Google and
		Yahoo, can achieve they are limited by the fact that the documents
		were never designed to be searched efficiently.</p>
      <p>Most
		documents created during the last 30 years are the output of word
		processor programs, such as Microsoft Word.  This is largely a
		consequence of the familiarity which almost everyone has these days
		with creating documents using a word processor as part of their work
		day.  Word processors are specifically designed to represent
		traditional paper documents with the final objective of actually
		creating such a paper document as the final output.  All current word
		processors use a user interface model called What You See Is What You
		Get (WYSIWYG).  That is the document appears on your computer screen
		as an image of the final printed paper document, complete to the use
		of black print on a white background, by contrast with the green
		print on a black background that was typical of the first generation
		of computer word processors.</p>
      <p>In
		particular one of the fundamental features of all current word
		processors is that the displayed information is organized as pages. 
		A sophisticated user knows how to set paragraph characteristics such
		as the widow and orphan settings which prevent a paragraph being
		split between two pages in such a way that only a single line appears
		on one of the pages.</p>
      <p>However
		in the transcription of historical documents this pagination may be
		counter-productive.  For example in the digital representation of a
		historical document what is important is the pagination of the
		original document, not the pagination of the transcription.</p>
      <p>This
		WYSIWYG feature also carries over into one of the most popular
		formats for representing documents on the web: <b>Portable Document
		Format (PDF)</b>.  PDF is a file format developed by Adobe Corporation to
		ensure that the electronic representation of a document looks on a
		computer screen exactly like the paper representation.  PDF is
		necessary because different word processors, or even the same word
		processor running on different computers, represent a document
		slightly differently.  As a specific example I asked a professional
		printing company to print a book for me and gave them a Microsoft
		Word .doc file.  They loaded that file into their copy of Microsoft
		Word, and attempted to print the book, but the result had a different
		pagination from the one on my computer because I was running
		Microsoft Word on Windows, while they, like most graphics companies,
		were running the version on Apple iOS.  One of the typical reasons
		for this pagination mismatch is that a word processor program uses
		the set of fonts that are shared by all of the programs on the
		computer, and the exact metrics (character dimensions) of a font
		depend upon exactly where it was obtained from.  PDF avoids this by
		including the font definitions in the document.</p>
      <p>PDF
		permits the distribution of accurate electronic versions of documents
		whose final representation is on paper.  For example the layout of a
		brochure, or a magazine, or a slide presentation, must be preserved
		in the electronic version.  However for the digital representation of
		transcriptions of historical documents PDF is an inappropriate form
		because it imposes a layout, including pagination, which obscures the
		structure of the original document.  Another issue is that PDF files
		are large, precisely because they must contain the accurate
		information about layout, and the programs that permit viewing them
		are also large and complex, because real-world paper documents come
		in a bewildering range of formats.  In particular the standard viewer
		for PDF, Adobe Acrobat, is much larger than the browser you use to
		access other information on the web.  Just loading this viewer
		application can slow the operation of your computer.  It is also a
		licensed software program which you must electronically sign an
		agreement for before you can use it.  That is why Adobe Acrobat is
		never included along with the other software when you buy a computer,
		but must be downloaded and installed the first time you try to view a
		file in PDF.</p>
      <p>All
		current word processors can also export a document as a web page,
		using the <b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b>.  This permits the
		contents of the document to be viewed without requiring the
		installation of the licensed PDF viewer application.  However without
		PDF the presentation of the document loses the fine precision of
		presentation.  In particular HTML does not even implement the concept
		of pages.  Illustrations embedded in a document lose their physical
		relationship to the related text, although references to figures and
		other document entities become click-able links.  A big advantage of
		HTML as a representation of document transcriptions is that it is
		indexed by the big search engines, and an organization can exploit
		search engine technology to index all of the HTML documents on their
		web-site.  The biggest problem with HTML is that images cannot be
		embedded as part of the web-page file itself, but must be stored in a
		separate web addressable location which is referenced by the main
		web-page.</p>
      <p>While
		both PDF and HTML documents can be searched, neither of them provides
		a structure for the information.  Both PDF and HTML are concerned
		primarily with the presentation of the information, not with its
		meaning.  So relationships between related pieces of information are
		lost whenever a document transcription is presented using these
		popular methods.  What do I mean by information relationships?  For
		example in the text “John Smith (1848-1912)” each of the words is
		related in a specific way to each of the other words.  That
		relationship is intrinsic to understanding the meaning of the text,
		but is not represented when the information is presented on the web
		either in a PDF or an HTML document.  If you use a search engine and
		search for “John Smith 1848 1912” you will get back a  list of
		all documents that contain each of those words, no matter where those
		words appear in the body of the document, not just documents about
        “John Smith (1848-1912)”.</p>
      <p>To publish a document such that the meaning and relationships of the
		separate pieces of the information is represented you need to use a
		format that represents a table of information.  Each column of a
		table represents a particular attribute, for example a surname or a
		birth date.  That is the answer to a specific question.  Each row of
		a table represents a single instance, for example a single birth
		certificate, or a single row of a census page.</p>
      <p>There are a bewildering number of ways to represent a table
        of information.
        This very wealth of choice may partially explain the unfortunate
		lack of exploitation of this capability by most web-sites and
		genealogical organizations.</p>
      <p>For those who have worked with <b>spreadsheets</b>
        as part of their daily work,
		they may provide a familiar choice.  You can easily create very large
		tables of information with a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft
		Excel.  A spreadsheet can be a excellent way to collect and organize
		information.  With the collaboration features of Google Sheets, for
		example, a team of volunteers could collectively create a spreadsheet
		that organized a transcription of a large municipal cemetery.  If the
		team of volunteers includes a technically sophisticated contributor
		the spreadsheet input can even validate the input, for example
		insisting that some fields must be numeric.</p>
      <p>Spreadsheets have a couple of minor disadvantages.  
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Organizing
      	  data is not the primary design goal of a spreadsheet program.  A
      	  spreadsheet is primarily designed to implement book-keeping and
      	  financial analysis functions.  Most cells in a typical business
      	  spreadsheet contain not values but expressions which act on
      	  information contained in other cells.  For example a cell may
      	  contain a column total or a percentage of another cell.  
      	</li>
      	<li>Spreadsheet
      	  programs are also concerned with what the final output looks like,
      	  such as what the borders around a cell look like, what font is used,
      	  what highlighting is used, and so on, so the final paper output will
      	  be more easily read. This is because one of the objectives of these
      	  programs is creating business reports.
      	</li>
      	<li>Spreadsheets
      	  do not implement the concept of columns of data which have a
      	  particular meaning very well.  You can tell the spreadsheet program
      	  that the first line of the spreadsheet contains the column names,
      	  and it will then permit you to, for example, sort the spreadsheet
      	  based upon the values in a particular column by name, but
      	  essentially the entire spreadsheet is treated by the program as a
      	  set of individual cells.  
      	</li>
      	<li>A
      	  spreadsheet program reads the entire spreadsheet file into your
      	  computer and works on it in memory.  This works well for typical
      	  business uses, but is impractical if, for example, you want to work
      	  on the 1920 Census of the United States of America which contains
      	  over a hundred million lines!  
      	</li>
      	<li>The
      	  search capabilities of spreadsheet programs are limited.  You can
      	  search a single column at a time for a specific value.  You cannot,
      	  without a lot of sophisticated programming, search a spreadsheet for
      	  “John Smith born in 1848”.
      	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The
		alternative tabular representation is as a <b>database</b> table.  An
		example of this is the Access component of Microsoft Office.  Unlike
		a spreadsheet, which is normally modified as often as it is viewed,
		databases are expressly designed with the primary purpose of
		facilitating searches and updates are performed only very rarely. 
		All popular database implementations implement a standard method of
		requesting a search through <b>Structured Query Language (SQL)</b>.  The
		abbreviation is pronounced “sequel”.  SQL is an extremely
		powerful language for expressing even very complex search requests
		and retrieving a response in a remarkably short time.  Unlike
		spreadsheets which can be no larger than the main memory of your
		computer, databases can be of any size because only the data you are
		actually using at a moment is loaded into the computer.   Because of
		their potentially great size databases are not normally distributed
		as files to end user computers.  Rather a user interface, frequently
		a web page on a browser, is all that runs in the end user device,
		permitting the user to issue requests for subsets of the contents of
		the database.  This makes such a database accessible on any device
		with a browser, such as a smart phone, a tablet, a laptop computer,
		or even an e-reader.  In the field of genealogy the largest such
		databases are those run by Ancestry and FamilySearch.org, but anyone
		can establish an account with a web-hosting company to run such a
		service for a few dollars a month.  That is a lot less than what your
		Internet Service Provider (ISP) charges to connect you to the
		Internet.</p>
      <p>If
		you do wish to distribute the contents of a spreadsheet or a
		database, you have the issue of choosing a file format to represent
		the information.  Actual data files, such as .xls, .xlsx, .mdb, or
        .ods are undesirable because they contain too much irrelevant
		information, such as expression formulas and formatting instructions,
		as well as actual executable code which can carry viruses.  The
		application can export all or part of the data as a PDF or HTML
		document, but then the information cannot be searched except as
		unorganized text.  Most commonly spreadsheets and databases are
		exported as text files that contain only the actual textual values of
		the cells.  The most common such format is Comma Separated Values
        (CSV) in which each line of the text file consists of values
		separated by commas.  To permit a value to contain a comma, the value
		is enclosed in quotes.  Another representation is Tab Separated
		Values (TSV) which is easier because it simply disallows the use of a
		tab character within a value, which is something that spreadsheet
		programs already do, since tab is used by the user interface to get
		to the next cell.  A CSV or TSV formatted file can then be loaded
		into a spreadsheet or database application, including Google Sheets
		through your browser, and searched column by column.  If distributed
		on a digital medium as a CSV file the file will automatically be
		opened in the default spreadsheet application when you click on it.</p>
      <p>Frequently
		non-profit genealogical organizations are reluctant to put the
		results of their volunteers' effort up on the web for free.  They
		have a number of concerns.  Loss of control of the information if it
		is distributed electronically is one.  However most conventional
		publications I have obtained from volunteer genealogical
		organizations have not properly asserted copyright, which means that
		they are already vulnerable to theft of knowledge.  Reputable
		organizations will not knowingly violate even an implied copyright on
		any electronic data they acquire.  Also family history societies look
		at the revenue the organization obtains through publication sales. 
		However that revenue should be balanced against the costs of
		supporting the publication sales, such as duplicating costs,
		maintaining inventory, accounts with credit card companies for
		payment, and so on.  As well there is the loss of potential
		advertising revenue that could be obtained from a web site, or the
		exchange of rights to access information between organizations.  Most
		importantly access to on-line databases created by a genealogical
		organization can be made a privilege of membership, increasing
		membership revenue and advertising revenue from other association
		publications.</p>
