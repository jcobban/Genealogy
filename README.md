Genealogical Research Website with Family Tree Management

This project implements a complete genealogical research system including the maintenance of a family tree on a shared web server implemented in PHP.
This permits any number of researchers to collaborate on a genealogical research project.  A major feature of this implementation is that it measures the degree of completeness of the research with respect to each of the documentary sources.
An example of a site which uses this code is www.jamescobban.net/genealogy.php.
The project uses a template engine to support multiple languages and to permit easy customization of the appearance of each page.
The project includes a set of object-oriented wrapper classes around each of the SQL tables which completely isolate the application code from the database implementation.
